You'll experience a tour before taking your students abroad, meet other new group leaders and gain valuable advice from experienced group leaders and EF staff.\u00a0\u00a0 Travel to Paris, France, Rome, Italy or Beijing, China! http:\/\/eftri.ps\/LOCl1P\n\n\n\"We want to take you on a Free International Training Tour, to experience a tour before traveling with students.  Only EF trains every new group leader in Paris, Rome or Beijing.  \"We just arrived in Paris for the group leader orientation for EF Tours.  Coming to Paris orientation I was definitely looking for tips and advice on how to better prepare my students, this is the first time I will be taking students anywhere. Our tour director is very helpful, with showing you how to use the train system, making us independent.  I think it's important to get over that initial fear of traveling abroad before you go with students because you have to be the one in charge, you have to be the leader, even if you are not sure you have to act like you are. I wish they'd had Paris orientation when I started, it's so helpful to know how to organize a tour which you really experience what your students will experience so that you have a very clear idea of what the experience will be like.  You come to Paris, it's all taken care of, so how could you say no to that, whirlwind weekend of sightseeing and then the EF orientation meeting.  I really have liked listening to people who have gone on 15, 16 tours, they're the ones who know whats going on, and they are extremely knowledgeable, I've learned great stuff from them.  I have taken 34 tours with EF and have two more ready to go this summer, it has been wonderful. I think its very important for my students to be traveling as early as they can, as much as they can. If we talk about the things before we go to a place, then it becomes more alive, they're really excited about learning, we're seeing where authors were born and died, and the stories behind them and that's really important, so id use that in my classroom a lot.  This has been an amazing experience, its a beautiful city, lots of history, and I've loved every moment here, i would definitely recommended that any teacher that has the ability, come to Paris, experience not only the city but experience what EF has to offer, it will definitely help prepare you for your trip.\"","playlistId":"PL10g2YT_ln2j7shoYX9xWFHGGNypozMwp","position":2,"publishedAt":"2016-05-05T20:17:53.000Z","title":"Free International Training Tour for Teachers | EF Educational
