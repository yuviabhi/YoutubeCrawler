Abstract : Large-scale public science communications programs can help practitioners create a grassroots network of science activators or \u201cvolunpeers,\u201d while providing high-quality cutting edge science content  - adapted by the needs of the region\/locale - directly for participants.   Evaluations of such projects have found that public science programs can lead to increased learning gains and interest in science topics as well as improved transparency of scientific information for participants.  Additionally, such programs have been shown to help practitioners sustain long-term, beneficial, working relationships with a system of empowered volunpeers.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNJtITf9fiN2R5tWJkpMCBJ6","position":0,"publishedAt":"2017-03-10T22:47:54.000Z","title":"Kim Arcand - Making Science Public: Mapping Exhibit Strategies for Volunteer Networks","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ax7ErsmgriE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ax7ErsmgriE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Ax7ErsmgriE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"Ax7ErsmgriE"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"Ax7ErsmgriE","videoPublishedAt":"2017-03-09T16:51:31.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/13vdYw8uz4Mtq6_FU9G7mtmqB0o\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSnRJVGY5ZmlOMlI1dFdKa3BNQ0JKNi4yODlGNEE0NkRGMEEzMEQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Kimberly Arcand, CfA, Visualization Lead for NASA's Chandra X-Ray Observatory; Tom Sgouros, Manager of the Brown University Virtual Reality Lab\n\nObjects in space are rather far away. The Moon is our closest celestial neighbor at nearly a quarter million miles from Earth, and the nearest star, our Sun, is 93 million miles away. These extreme distances mean that it\u2019s usually impossible to touch real objects in space (meteorites that fall to the ground notwithstanding). But now, thanks to data from some of our favorite observatories, anyone can hold a dead star in their hand. Here\u2019s how. Arcand, of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory, will talk about the process of creating the first data-based 3D model and print of an exploded star. At the end of Arcand's talk, she will be joined by Tom Sgouros, a researcher with and on virtual reality at the Brown University Center for Computation and Visualization. Arcand and Sgouros have worked together to develop software, using Occulus Rift technology, allowing observers virtual first-hand experience of a supernova remnant like never before. \n\nOriginal music by Mark C.
