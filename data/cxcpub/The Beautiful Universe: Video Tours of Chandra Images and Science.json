This ring sounds like it might belong in Tolkien's Middle Earth, but it is, in fact, found in a galaxy about 300 million light years from Earth.\n\nThe galaxy called AM 0644-741 is what astronomers refer to as a \"ring\" galaxy. Taking a look at the image quickly reveals why. Astronomers think ring galaxies are formed when one galaxy smashes into another in a catastrophic collision. The impact generates ripples in the interstellar gas of the targeted galaxy. These ripples, in turn, trigger new waves of star formation as gas expands outward from the site of the collision.\n\nThe most massive of these fledgling stars will lead short lives \u2014 in cosmic terms \u2014 of millions of years. After that, their nuclear fuel is spent and the stars explode as supernovas leaving behind either black holes with masses less than about a hundred times that of the Sun, or neutron stars with a mass approximately equal to one and a half times of the Sun.\n\nSome of these black holes and neutron stars have closecompanion stars, and siphon gas from their stellar partner. This gas falls towards the black hole or neutron star, forming a spinning disk like water circling a drain, and becomes heated by friction. This superheated gas produces large amounts of X-rays that Chandra can detect.\n\nAstronomers are on a quest to study AM 0644-741 and others like it to better understand the origins of ring galaxies and the intriguing objects that they contain.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":0,"publishedAt":"2018-09-06T19:49:12.000Z","title":"A Tour of Ring Galaxy AM 0644-741","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/naGb2GDiD9Y\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/naGb2GDiD9Y\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/naGb2GDiD9Y\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"naGb2GDiD9Y"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"naGb2GDiD9Y","videoPublishedAt":"2018-09-06T19:49:23.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/hECXYRAjPnQvxz1mDpkEmfBc0G4\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy4wNjIzRDA1OTQ2M0UyODEw","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"This video is private.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":1,"publishedAt":"2018-09-05T22:04:13.000Z","title":"Private video","resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"l-QKJDo2r9Y"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"l-QKJDo2r9Y","videoPublishedAt":null}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/UB05DQSyXGSrGKVs3xZbv4YSH3U\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy4wQjA4QkVEQ0RFREIzMjFC","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Scientists have taken major steps in their hunt to find black holes that are neither very small nor extremely large. Finding these elusive so-called intermediate-mass black holes could help astronomers better understand how the largest black holes in the early Universe formed.\n\nThe new research comes from two separate studies, each using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes. \n\nBlack holes that contain between about one hundred and several hundred thousand times the mass of the Sun are known as intermediate-mass black holes. This is because their mass places them in between the well-documented and frequently-studied \"stellar mass\" black holes on one end of the mass scale and the \"supermassive black holes\" found in the central regions of massive galaxies on the other.\n\nWhile several possible intermediate-mass black holes have been reported in recent years, astronomers are still trying to determine how common they are and what their properties teach us about the formation of the first supermassive black holes.\n\nOne team identified forty growing black holes in dwarf galaxies. Twelve of them are located at distances more than five billion light years from Earth and the most distant is 10.9 billion light years away, the most distant growing black hole in a dwarf galaxy ever seen. One of the dwarf galaxies is the least massive galaxy found to host a growing black hole in its center.\n\nA second team found a separate, important sample of possible intermediate-mass black holes in galaxies that are closer to us. In their sample, the most distant candidate is about 2.8 billion light years from Earth and about 90% of their candidates they discovered are no more than 1.3 billion light years away.This makes them relatively nearby in cosmic terms.\n\nAstronomers are intrigued by intermediate-mass black holes for several reasons, including that they may play a role in the formation of supermassive black holes in the early Universe. They will continue to use Chandra and other telescopes to track these elusive and fascinating objects.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":2,"publishedAt":"2018-08-09T13:56:56.000Z","title":"A Tour of COSMOS Legacy Survey","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h07hCkFe49U\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h07hCkFe49U\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h07hCkFe49U\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h07hCkFe49U\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h07hCkFe49U\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"h07hCkFe49U"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"h07hCkFe49U","videoPublishedAt":"2018-08-09T14:59:24.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/xNRBIkjvJRC-gAJZNXRh06-7UMc\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy41QTQ4QTIyM0Y1RTBGMUNE","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Since 1937, astronomers have puzzled over the curious variability of a young star named RW Aur A, which is located about 450 light years from Earth. Every few decades, the star's optical light has faded briefly before brightening again. In recent years, astronomers have observed the star dimming more frequently, and for longer periods. \n\nUsing NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, a team of scientists may have uncovered what caused the star's most recent dimming event: a collision of two infant planetary bodies. Once the planets were destroyed, the debris would have fallen onto the star, generating a thick veil of dust and gas. This would have temporarily obscured the star's light, explaining the dimming astronomers have seen. \n\nComputer simulations have long predicted that planets can fall into a young star, but scientists have never before observed that before now. If this most recent study is correct, it would be the first time that astronomers have directly observed a young star devouring a planet.\n\nBecause the X-rays come from the hot outer atmosphere of the star, changes in the X-ray spectrum \u2014 the intensity of X-rays measured at different wavelengths \u2014 over these three observations were used to probe the density and composition of the absorbing material around the star. \n\nThe team found that the dips in both optical and X-ray light are caused by dense gas obscuring the star's light. The observation in 2017 showed strong emission from iron atoms, indicating that the disk contained at least 10 times more iron than in the 2013 observation during a bright period.\n\nThe researchers think the excess iron was created when two planetesimals, or infant planetary bodies, collided. If one or both planetary bodies are made partly of iron, their smash-up could release a large amount of iron into the star's disk and temporarily obscure its light as the material falls into the star. \n\nThis discovery gives insight into the processes affecting the development of infant planets. Undoubtedly, astronomers will continue to study this fascinating object with Chandra and other telescopes.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":3,"publishedAt":"2018-07-18T14:08:12.000Z","title":"A Tour of RW Aur A","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RlDdbJASbcY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RlDdbJASbcY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RlDdbJASbcY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RlDdbJASbcY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"RlDdbJASbcY"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"RlDdbJASbcY","videoPublishedAt":"2018-07-18T14:59:41.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/2kZ1oEh99KJgXg6TpwywftbESH4\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy5CRjBFOTUzQTE4Mjg3RUJF","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"About a decade ago, astronomers discovered a population of small, but massive galaxies called \"red nuggets.\" A new study using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory indicates that black holes have squelched star formation in these galaxies and may have used some of the untapped stellar fuel to grow to unusually massive proportions.\n\nRed nuggets were first discovered by the Hubble Space Telescope at great distances from Earth, corresponding to times only about three or four billion years after the Big Bang. They are relics of the first massive galaxies that formed within only one billion years after the Big Bang. Astronomers think they are the ancestors of the giant elliptical galaxies seen in the local Universe. The masses of red nuggets are similar to those of giant elliptical galaxies, but they are only about a fifth of their size.\n\nWhile most red nuggets merged with other galaxies over billions of years, a small number managed to slip through the long history of the cosmos untouched. These unscathed red nuggets represent a golden opportunity to study how the galaxies, and the supermassive black hole at their centers, act over billions of years of isolation.\n\nFor the first time, Chandra has been used to study the hot gas in two of these isolated red nuggets, Mrk 1216, and PGC 032673. They are located only 295 million and 344 million light years from Earth respectively, rather than billions of light years for the first known red nuggets. This X-ray emitting hot gas contains the imprint of activity generated by the supermassive black holes in each of the two galaxies.\n\nThe Chandra results show these supermassive black holes not only prevent new stars from forming, they might also swipe some of the stellar material to add bulk to themselves. This may have allowed the black holes in these two galaxies to swell to more five billion times the Sun. The Chandra data are helping to tell the story of what happens to these red nugget galaxies over their long, solitary journey through cosmic time.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":4,"publishedAt":"2018-06-21T13:45:28.000Z","title":"A Tour of Mrk 1216","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ApTMAbsqWfk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ApTMAbsqWfk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ApTMAbsqWfk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ApTMAbsqWfk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"ApTMAbsqWfk"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"ApTMAbsqWfk","videoPublishedAt":"2018-06-21T15:00:04.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/tjKi8CBrO7PH6jh8_wZlG5SaPEk\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy5ENUI5OTFCQkYxNDUxQjQ3","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"In humanity's search for life outside our Solar System, one of the best places to look is Alpha Centauri, a system containing the three nearest stars beyond the Sun.\n\nA new study that has involved monitoring of Alpha Centauri for more than a decade by NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory provides encouraging news about one key aspect of planetary habitability. It indicates that any planets orbiting the two brightest stars in the Alpha Cen system are likely not being pummeled by large amounts of X-ray radiation from their host stars.\n\nAlpha Centauri is a triple star system located just over four light years, or about 25 trillion miles, from Earth. While this is a large distance in terrestrial terms, it is three times closer than the next nearest Sun-like star.\n\nThe stars in the Alpha Centauri system include a pair called \"A\" and \"B,\" that we'll call AB, which orbit relatively close to each other. Alpha Cen A is a near twin of our Sun in almost every way, including age, while Alpha Cen B is somewhat smaller and dimmer but still quite similar to the Sun. The third member, Alpha Cen C (also known as Proxima), is a much smaller red dwarf star that travels around the AB pair in a much larger orbit that takes it more than 10 thousand times farther from the AB pair than the Earth-Sun distance. Proxima currently holds the title of the nearest star to Earth, although AB is a very close second.\n\nThe Chandra data reveal that the prospects for life in terms of current X-ray bombardment are actually better around Alpha Cen A than for the Sun, and Alpha Cen B fares only slightly worse.

This puts it on a tightrope of identity, implying it is either the most massive neutron star ever found or the lowest mass black hole ever found. The previous record holders for the latter are no less than about four or five times the Sun's mass.\n\nThe Chandra observations are telling, not only for what they revealed, but also for what they did not. If the neutron stars merged and formed a heavier neutron star, then astronomers would expect it to spin rapidly and generate a very strong magnetic field. This, in turn, would have created an expanding bubble of high-energy particles that would result in bright X-ray emission.

NGC 6231, located about 5,200 light years from Earth, is an ideal testbed for studying a stellar cluster at a critical stage of its evolution: not long after star formation has stopped.\n\nThe discovery of NGC 6231 is attributed to Giovanni Battista Hodierna, an Italian mathematician and priest who published observations of the cluster in 1654. Sky watchers today can find the star cluster to the southwest of the tail of the constellation Scorpius.\n\nNASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory has been used to identify the young Sun-like stars in NGC 6231, which have, until recently, been hiding in plain sight. Young star clusters like NGC 6231 are found in the band of the Milky Way on the sky. As a result, interloping stars lying in front of or behind NGC 6231 greatly outnumber the stars in the cluster. These stars will generally be much older than those in NGC 6231, so members of the cluster can be identified by selecting signs of stellar youth. The Chandra data, combined with infrared data from the VISTA telescope, have provided the best census of young stars in NGC 6231 available.\n\nBy studying this cluster and others like it, astronomers hope to better understand our Sun's origins and our shared cosmic ancestry with stars across the Galaxy.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":10,"publishedAt":"2018-04-26T14:53:14.000Z","title":"A Tour of NGC 6231","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vIvNzr-MkBA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vIvNzr-MkBA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vIvNzr-MkBA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vIvNzr-MkBA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vIvNzr-MkBA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"vIvNzr-MkBA"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"vIvNzr-MkBA","videoPublishedAt":"2018-05-02T17:00:23.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/2Z8e-J1Z_ryjKWSoEXXf9o4WOvY\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy40MzEwNkU4RUE0MjhBRjg4","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Winter often brings many intense and powerful storms, with cold fronts sweeping across many parts of the globe. There are, however, even bigger weather systems. For example, astronomers have discovered cold fronts in space that are millions of light years in extent and older than the Solar System.\n\nFor example, researchers used NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory to study a cold front located in the Perseus galaxy cluster that extends for about two million light years, or about 10 billion billion miles. \n\nGalaxy clusters are the largest and most massive objects in the Universe that are held together by gravity. In between the hundreds or even thousands of galaxies in a cluster, there are vast reservoirs of super-heated gas that glow brightly in X-ray light.\n\nThe cold front in the Perseus cluster consists of a relatively dense band of gas with a \"cool\" temperature of about 30 million degrees moving through lower density hot gas of about 80 million degrees. The enormous cold front formed about 5 billion years ago and has been traveling at speeds of about 300,000 miles per hour ever since. \n\nThe cold front has not only survived for over a third of the age of the Universe, but it has also remained surprisingly sharp and split into two different pieces. \n\nAstronomers expected that such an old cold front would have been blurred out or eroded over time because it has traveled for billions of years through a harsh environment of sound waves and turbulence caused by outbursts from the huge black hole at the center of Perseus. Instead, the sharpness of the Perseus cold front suggests that the structure has been preserved by magnetic fields that are wrapped around it.\n\nPerseus is the same cluster where astronomers use Chandra to discover sound waves with a note of B-flat 57 octaves below middle-C plus a giant wave about twice the width of the Milky Way galaxy. Astronomers will continue to use Chandra and other telescopes to study this fascinating galaxy cluster.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":11,"publishedAt":"2018-04-03T18:18:26.000Z","title":"A Tour of the Cold Front in the Perseus Cluster","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HeIgLnTFwNs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HeIgLnTFwNs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HeIgLnTFwNs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HeIgLnTFwNs\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HeIgLnTFwNs\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"HeIgLnTFwNs"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"HeIgLnTFwNs","videoPublishedAt":"2018-04-03T19:00:21.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/k_j5paqegeMZ0iG8KRGf-l0O0_Y\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy42RDgxQ0M2OUIwREZCNjZF","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"The year 2019 marks the 20th anniversary of the launch of NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory into space. The Crab Nebula was one of the first objects that Chandra examined with its sharp X-ray vision, and it has been a frequent target of the telescope ever since.\n\nThere are many reasons that the Crab Nebula is such a well-studied object. For example, it is one of a handful of cases where there is strong historical evidence for when the star exploded. Having this definitive timeline helps astronomers understand the details of the explosion and its aftermath.\n\nIn the case of the Crab, observers in several countries reported the appearance of a \"new star\" in 1054 A.D. in the direction of the constellation Taurus. Much has been learned about the Crab in the centuries since. Today, astronomers know that the Crab Nebula is powered by a quickly spinning, highly magnetized neutron star called a pulsar, which was formed when a massive star ran out of its nuclear fuel and collapsed. The combination of rapid rotation and a strong magnetic field in the Crab generates an intense electromagnetic field that creates jets of matter and anti-matter moving away from both the north and south poles of the pulsar. Astronomers also see an intense wind flowing out in the equatorial direction.\n\nA new composite image adds to a scientific legacy, spanning nearly two decades, between Chandra and the Crab Nebula. We look forward to what the Crab Nebula will reveal next.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":12,"publishedAt":"2018-03-13T18:13:28.000Z","title":"A Tour of the Crab Nebula","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lyB0oqccNqo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lyB0oqccNqo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/lyB0oqccNqo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"lyB0oqccNqo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"lyB0oqccNqo","videoPublishedAt":"2018-03-14T12:59:46.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/7aSl3AyjdfzDpAWiyl1cd_qSHY4\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy40ODU2MTBGM0M5MkIwQzU0","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Two groups of scientists, using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes, have found evidence that the growth of the biggest black holes in the Universe is outrunning the rate of formation of stars in the galaxies they inhabit. \n\nThis would be quite a surprise. Over many years, astronomers have gathered data on the formation of stars in galaxies and the growth of supermassive black holes \u2014 that is, those with millions or billions the mass of the Sun \u2014 in their centers. These data suggested that the black holes and the stars in their host galaxies grow in tandem with each other. \n\nNow, findings from two independent groups of researchers indicate that the black holes in massive galaxies have grown much faster than in the less massive ones. \n\nUsing large amounts of data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope, the world's biggest radio telescopes, and more, these scientists have reconstructed a race that began billions of years ago. \n\nThis research leads the astronomers to ask: why? What leads these giant black holes to get a jump on growth over their galactic hosts? Do they simply grow faster or do they have a head start? \n\nWhile these are difficult questions to answer, luckily astronomers have amazing resources like the Chandra Deep Field-South at their disposal. This dataset is the deepest X-ray image ever obtained, representing millions of seconds of Chandra exposure time. This one dataset gives astronomers a window into what black holes were doing billions of years ago.

Although scientists have made progress in better understanding dark matter, the true nature of this invisible material remains elusive.\n\nNASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory plays an important role in the search to learn about dark matter. One way that astronomers have used Chandra to investigate dark matter has been through the study of a mysterious signal seen in the X-ray data. In 2014, astronomers reported they found a spike of intensity at a very specific energy in Chandra and XMM-Newton observations of the hot gas in the Perseus and other galaxy clusters. This spike, or emission line, is at an energy of 3.5 kiloelectron volts, or keV (pronounced \"kay-ee-vee\"), and could not easily be explained as emission from known elements. Therefore, one possibility was that this line was produced by dark matter particles.\n\nNaturally, determining the true nature of dark matter would be a huge discovery. And as Carl Sagan famously said, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. Therefore, astronomers have been working hard both to replicate the initial results and also provide explanations for all of the observations connected to this original finding.\n\nNow a new team of astronomers has provided an innovative interpretation of the observations surrounding this 3.5 keV line. They propose that there is another mechanism at work, namely the absorption of X-ray light by mystery particles. If this is true, then it's possible that the 3.5 keV line may, in fact, be produced by dark matter particles. While these ideas need to be confirmed with future observations, it may be that the prospect of determining the nature of the darkest of matter may never have been more so bright.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":14,"publishedAt":"2017-12-19T14:51:39.000Z","title":"A Tour of the Perseus Cluster","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hdJ5ZnB7bvA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hdJ5ZnB7bvA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hdJ5ZnB7bvA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"hdJ5ZnB7bvA"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"hdJ5ZnB7bvA","videoPublishedAt":"2017-12-19T18:00:04.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/apH1XI-RsqUfk86nvq1MAT45DdM\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy5FQjcyRDZBMEMyNTY3OTdE","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Where do most of the elements essential for life on Earth come from? The answer: inside the furnaces of stars and the explosions that mark the end of some stars' lives.\n\nAstronomers have long studied exploded stars and their remains \u2014 known as \"supernova remnants\" \u2014 to better understand exactly how stars produce and then disseminate many of the elements on Earth and throughout the cosmos.\n\nCassiopeia A, or Cas A for short, is one of the most intensely studied of these supernova remnants. A new image from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory shows the location of different elements in the remains of the explosion: silicon, sulfur, calcium, and iron. Each of these elements produces X-rays within narrow energy ranges, allowing maps of their location to be created. Astronomers also see the blast wave from the explosion in the form of the blue outer ring.\n\nX-ray telescopes such as Chandra are important to study supernova remnants and the elements they produce because these events generate extremely high temperatures \u2014 millions of degrees \u2014 that remain even thousands of years after the explosion. This means that many supernova remnants, including Cas A, glow most strongly at X-ray wavelengths that are undetectable with other types of telescopes.\n\nChandra's sharp X-ray vision helps astronomers not only determine what elements are present in Cas A, but also how much of each there is. For example, Cas A has dispersed about 10,000 Earth masses worth of sulfur alone, and about 20,000 Earth masses of silicon. The iron in Cas A weighs about 70,000 times that of the Earth, and astronomers detect a whopping one million Earth masses worth of oxygen being ejected into space from Cas A, equivalent to about three times the mass of the Sun.\n\nChandra has repeatedly observed Cas A since the telescope was launched into space in 1999. It will continue to do so, revealing new information about the dense core left behind in the center of Cas A, details of the powerful explosion, and specifics of how the important debris is ejected into space.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":15,"publishedAt":"2017-12-12T17:23:15.000Z","title":"A Tour of Cassiopeia A","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-RYADIlW7vk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-RYADIlW7vk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-RYADIlW7vk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-RYADIlW7vk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"-RYADIlW7vk"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"-RYADIlW7vk","videoPublishedAt":"2017-12-12T18:00:04.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/SYbFrs7Kl2pk2XTJY1wQBmpJNdI\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy4wMEMyQTBBOTUwNTM0OUFG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"This video is unavailable.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":16,"publishedAt":"2017-11-30T14:25:21.000Z","title":"Deleted video","resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"JhAK1AA8Iqg"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"JhAK1AA8Iqg","videoPublishedAt":null}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/e5TsVRNDng_BBSq88rtdyEQq0yk\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy44M0Q5MzQ0QTcwQzFDMjc5","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"On Earth, people at very high latitudes sometimes enjoy the spectacular light shows known as the auroras, also called the northern or southern lights. Our planet is not, however, the only world to experience auroras. For some time, scientists have observed high-energy auroras on Jupiter in the form of ultraviolet and X-ray light. A new study using data from NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESA\u2019s XMM-Newton shows that the auroras on Jupiter are significantly different than those on Earth. Scientists have discovered that Jupiter\u2019s auroras behave independently of one another at each pole. This is unlike Earth, where the northern and southern lights tend to mirror one another.\n\nTo understand how Jupiter produces its X-ray auroras, researchers plan to combine new and upcoming X-ray data from Chandra and XMM-Newton with information from NASA\u2019s Juno mission, which is currently in orbit around the planet. If scientists can connect the X-ray activity with physical changes observed simultaneously with Juno, they may be able to determine the process that generates the Jovian auroras.\n\nThere are many questions this new X-ray study pose: how does Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field give particles the huge energies needed to make X-rays? Do these high-energy particles affect the Jovian weather and the chemical composition of its atmosphere? Can they explain the unusually high temperatures found in certain places in Jupiter\u2019s atmosphere?

Studies like these show that X-rays can play a critical role in the ultimate question of where life might exist elsewhere in the Universe.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":21,"publishedAt":"2017-09-06T13:35:31.000Z","title":"A Tour of GJ 176","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/56M0VnYtnFo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/56M0VnYtnFo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/56M0VnYtnFo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/56M0VnYtnFo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/56M0VnYtnFo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"56M0VnYtnFo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"56M0VnYtnFo","videoPublishedAt":"2017-09-06T17:00:25.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/3OrdlvjWfGwYcogUZaulwVyxTL4\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy5ENjg3MEUyQ0IzODMzQThB","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Long before Starburst\u00ae became a popular brand of candy, starbursts were known to astronomers. In 1887, American astronomer Lewis Swift discovered a glowing cloud, or nebula, that turned out to be a small galaxy about 2.2 million light years from Earth. Today, it is known as the \u201cstarburst\u201d galaxy IC 10, referring to the intense star formation activity occurring there.\n\nMore than a hundred years after Swift\u2019s discovery, astronomers are studying IC 10 with the most powerful telescopes of the 21st century. New observations with NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory reveal many pairs of stars that may one day become sources of perhaps the most exciting cosmic phenomenon observed in recent years: gravitational waves.\n\nBy analyzing Chandra observations of IC 10 spanning a decade, astronomers found over a dozen black holes and neutron stars feeding off gas from young, massive stellar companions. Such double star systems are known as \u201cX-ray binaries\u201d because they emit large amounts of X-ray light. As a massive star orbits around its compact companion, either a black hole or neutron star, material can be pulled away from the giant star to form a disk of material around the compact object. Frictional forces heat the infalling material to millions of degrees, producing a bright X-ray source.\n\nWhen the massive companion star runs out fuel, it will undergo a catastrophic collapse that will produce a supernova explosion, and leave behind a black hole or neutron star. The end result is two compact objects: either a pair of black holes, a pair of neutron stars, or a black hole and neutron star. If the separation between the compact objects becomes small enough as time passes, they will produce gravitational waves. Over time, the size of their orbit will shrink until they merge. LIGO has found three examples of black hole pairs merging in this way in the past two years.\n\nAstronomers will continue to study IC 10 and other similar galaxies to better understand more about X-ray binaries and their connection to the exciting and evolving field of gravitational wave astronomy.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":22,"publishedAt":"2017-08-15T16:00:34.000Z","title":"A Tour of IC 10","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BKTyBNSz0ZA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BKTyBNSz0ZA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BKTyBNSz0ZA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BKTyBNSz0ZA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BKTyBNSz0ZA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"BKTyBNSz0ZA"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"BKTyBNSz0ZA","videoPublishedAt":"2017-08-15T16:00:32.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ahTUZA61yus1Pez-28fSzo-vBe0\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy5EODkyNDMzRkJBNkQ2NkMz","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"In the context of space, the term \u2018cloud\u2019 can mean something rather different from the fluffy white collections of water in the sky or a way to store data or process information.

This is due at least in part to the merger of the two galaxies, which has triggered waves of star formation. The formation of high-mass X-ray binaries is a natural consequence of the blossoming star birth in Arp 299 as some of the young massive stars, which often form in pairs, evolve into these systems.\n \nWhile Arp 299 is intriguing itself, this system also has similarities to more distant galaxies.

New research using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and the Sloan Digital Sky Survey \u2014 called the SDSS \u2014 suggests that an answer to this question lies with the intermittent way giant black holes may consume material in the first billion years after the Big Bang. \n\nAstronomers have determined the Big Bang occurred about 13.8 billion years ago and have evidence from the SDSS that supermassive black holes with masses of about a billion times that of the sun existed by about 12.8 billion years ago. This implies that supermassive black holes grew rapidly in the first billion years after the Big Bang. Yet, scientists have struggled to find signs of these growing giant black holes. \n\nTo address this conundrum, an all-female team of researchers examined different theoretical models and tested them against optical data from the SDSS and X-ray data from Chandra. Their findings indicate that black hole feeding during this era may turn on abruptly and last for short periods of time, which means this growth may be difficult to spot. \n\nThe timing of such growth may be key. The authors' model suggests that 13 billion years ago, about one third of supermassive black holes may have been accreting enough matter to be detectable. Just 200 million years earlier \u2014 a veritable blip in cosmic time \u2014 the number of potentially detectable black holes is only about 3%. In order to test this idea further, the researchers suggest that surveys with Chandra and future X-ray telescope that look at larger areas of the sky in X-rays are necessary.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":26,"publishedAt":"2017-05-31T10:36:06.000Z","title":"A Tour of Faint Active Nuclei in Chandra Deep Field South","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_NIjnsVlgug\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_NIjnsVlgug\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_NIjnsVlgug\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_NIjnsVlgug\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_NIjnsVlgug\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"_NIjnsVlgug"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"_NIjnsVlgug","videoPublishedAt":"2017-05-31T12:49:36.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/MqUCVjF5nUafx4tYMcarWQ-Ll3A\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy4xRDJGOTc4RkUxMzUwMUFG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Giant black holes are generally stationary objects, sitting at the centers of most galaxies.

There are many possible combinations of binary systems: stars like the Sun orbiting each other, two neutron stars, a massive star and a smaller one, and so on. Binary systems are useful to astronomers for many reasons, including being useful laboratories to measure the masses of stars.\n \nRecently, astronomers have found a particularly interesting binary. This pair has a white dwarf star in orbit around a black hole. While scientists have found this configuration many times before, this binary, known as X9, is special. That\u2019s because it has the closest orbit ever seen between a black hole and a companion star.\n \nThe X9 system is located in 47 Tucanae, a dense star cluster in the outskirts of the Milky Way. Using NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory along with data from other telescopes, researchers determined that the white dwarf makes one complete orbit around the black hole in less than a half an hour. This means that the separation between the white dwarf and the black hole is about two and half times the distance between the Earth and the Moon. In cosmic terms, these two objects are extremely close together.\n \nWhat does this close pairing mean for the objects in X9? The extreme proximity likely spells a bleak future for the white dwarf. Although scientists don\u2019t expect the white dwarf to fall into the black hole, they do think so much material will be pulled from the star that it will one day become some sort of exotic planet or even evaporate all together. In the short term, astronomers are going to watch this system very closely, because they don\u2019t know exactly how such an extreme system will behave.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":30,"publishedAt":"2017-03-13T13:35:25.000Z","title":"A Tour of X9 in 47 Tucanae","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vA45oZNcqEc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vA45oZNcqEc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vA45oZNcqEc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vA45oZNcqEc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vA45oZNcqEc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"vA45oZNcqEc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"vA45oZNcqEc","videoPublishedAt":"2017-03-13T17:00:22.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/nvNQoJ4J9g8FRRP3_jA1KSGWeb8\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy42NEZDNTU0RTRENDUzRjMz","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Thirty years ago on February 24, 1987, observers in the southern hemisphere noticed a new object in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Today, we know this object as Supernova 1987A, and it was one of the brightest supernova seen in hundreds of years. Coupled with its relative proximity at about 160,000 light years from Earth, Supernova 1987A became one of the best opportunities ever for astronomers to study the phases before, during, and after the death of a star.\n \nSince its discovery, telescopes around the world and in space have observed Supernova 1987A. This includes NASA\u2019s Chandra X-ray Observatory, which has looked at this object repeatedly during its 17 years of science operations.  \n \nFrom 1999 until 2013, Chandra data showed an expanding ring of X-ray emission that had been steadily getting brighter. This was produced by the blast wave from the original explosion that had been bursting through and heating the ring of gas surrounding the supernova.\n \nIn the past few years, there have been striking changes in the Chandra data. This provides evidence that the explosion\u2019s blast wave has moved beyond the ring into a region with less dense gas. This represents the end of an era for SN 1987A. Since astronomers do not know exactly lies beyond the ring, they will be watching carefully what happens next.\n\nOver the next few thousand years, the expanding shell of hot gas will continue to glow in X rays. Eventually after rumbling across several thousand light years, the shell will disperse. By doing this, the supernova spreads the heavy elements created in the star and possibly triggers the formation of new stars from a cold interstellar cloud. Using data from Chandra and other telescopes, astronomers will continue to learn more about the details of this very important process that is responsible for life as we know it.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":31,"publishedAt":"2017-02-24T01:54:43.000Z","title":"A Tour of Supernova 1987A","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ITvAdZzNFb0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ITvAdZzNFb0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ITvAdZzNFb0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ITvAdZzNFb0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"ITvAdZzNFb0"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"ITvAdZzNFb0","videoPublishedAt":"2017-02-24T15:00:32.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/3ab3suBAQdPNVyap2XHA0Bdhw6k\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy5ENEEyOTIwNkY4NzFGMkQ2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Every so often, an object will pass too close to a black hole and be ripped apart by its intense gravitational forces. As the object, such as a star, approaches the danger zone of the black hole, its stellar debris is flung outward at high speeds, while the star's material falls towards the black hole. This in-falling material becomes hotter and hotter until it generates a signature outburst of X-rays. Astronomers call these \"tidal disruption events,\" or TDEs, and they can be used to better understand how black holes grow and affect their environments. \n\u00a0\nWhile astronomers have seen multiple examples of TDEs in recent years, a new discovery stands out among the rest. Using data from three X-ray telescopes: Chandra, Swift, and XMM-Newton, researchers have found a TDE that has lasted about ten years, much longer than other events. What could cause this decade-long meal by the black hole? There are a couple of possibilities. The first is that this black hole, located in a galaxy about 1.8 billion light years from Earth, completely shredded the largest star astronomers have known to be destroyed in a TDE. The other, also intriguing, possibility is that in previous TDEs the star wasn't completely ripped apart, but in this event it was. While astronomers continue to study this source and look for others like it, we are reminded just how amazing black holes can be.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":32,"publishedAt":"2017-02-06T18:55:20.000Z","title":"A Tour of

Using these data, researchers showed that these black holes in the early Universe grow mostly in bursts, rather than via the slow accumulation of matter. \n\nThe researchers also detected X-rays from massive galaxies at distances up to about 12.5 billion light years from Earth. Most of the X-ray emission from the most distant galaxies likely comes from large collections of stellar-mass black holes within the galaxies. These black holes are formed from the collapse of massive stars and typically weigh a few to a few dozen times the mass of the Sun. \n\nBy combining the Chandra Deep Field with observations from other telescopes including Hubble, scientists can continue to probe some of the most important questions in astrophysics.","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":41,"publishedAt":"2017-01-20T16:56:32.000Z","title":"Tour of Chandra Deep Field South","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ow0mZBdJQM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ow0mZBdJQM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ow0mZBdJQM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9ow0mZBdJQM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"9ow0mZBdJQM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"9ow0mZBdJQM","videoPublishedAt":"2017-01-06T16:40:28.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Brpn8Sg_XDUWbnfuZ47WWCbM1Ko\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy5CQzUwREI3MzkxQjdBM0E0","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"There are many extraordinary things in the Universe.

Also, X-rays can penetrate the shrouds of gas and dust surrounding these infant stars, allowing astronomers to see details of star birth that would be otherwise missed. \n\nFor more information: http:\/\/chandra.si.edu\/photo\/2016\/ngc6357\/","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":43,"publishedAt":"2017-01-20T16:55:58.000Z","title":"A Tour of NGC 6357","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CI_Zmm6LMn8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CI_Zmm6LMn8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CI_Zmm6LMn8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CI_Zmm6LMn8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CI_Zmm6LMn8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"CI_Zmm6LMn8"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"CI_Zmm6LMn8","videoPublishedAt":"2016-12-21T17:53:25.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/dyonyqAXUWrzaXJ6cdADKPX7BCk\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy43ODA2MDVCQzY5QzZDMjUw","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Astronomers have used NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and other telescopes to show that a very distant galaxy is undergoing an extraordinary boom of stellar construction. The galaxy is 12.7 billion light years from Earth, which means it is at a critical stage in the evolution of galaxies about a billion years after the Big Bang. \n\nAfter astronomers discovered the galaxy, known as SPT 0346-52, with the South Pole Telescope, they observed it with several space and other ground-based telescopes. Data from the Atacama Large Millimeter\/submillimeter Array revealed this galaxy was giving off tremendous amounts of infrared light. \n\nThis excess infrared light could be explaining by a huge burst of star formation. However, there was another possibility: What if the infrared emission was instead caused by a rapidly growing supermassive black hole at the galaxy's center? Gas falling towards the black hole would become much hotter and brighter, causing surrounding dust and gas to glow in infrared light. \n\nTo explore this possibility, researchers used Chandra and the Australia Telescope Compact Array, a radio telescope. If there was a massive, growing black hole in the middle of SPT0346-52, it should give off enough X-rays and radio waves for these telescopes to detect. \n\nThe result was that neither Chandra nor the Australia Telescope Compact Array saw emission coming from SPT0346-52. The absence of X-rays and radio waves let astronomers rule out a growing black hole being responsible for most of the bright infrared light. \n\nInstead of this galaxy containing a gorging black hole, astronomers know it is shining brightly with the light from newborn stars. This gives scientists information about how galaxies and the stars within them evolve during some of the earliest times in the Universe.\n\nFor more information:\nhttp:\/\/chandra.si.edu\/press\/16_releases\/press_120816.html","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":44,"publishedAt":"2017-01-20T16:55:44.000Z","title":"A Tour of SPT 0346-52","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tqmBHzhLNwE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tqmBHzhLNwE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tqmBHzhLNwE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tqmBHzhLNwE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"tqmBHzhLNwE"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"tqmBHzhLNwE","videoPublishedAt":"2016-12-12T21:07:34.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/qWg4jQOWnYRWf-2mHT2XdlIrT8A\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy5GNzk2RTlDQTNCQzJCQzJG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Astronomers have found a pair of extraordinary objects that dramatically burst in X-rays. This discovery, made using data from NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and ESA's XMM-Newton observatory, may represent a new class of explosive events.\n\nThe mysterious sources flare up and become about a hundred times brighter in X-rays in less than a minute, before returning to the original X-ray levels after about an hour. One of the sources, located near and presumably associated with the galaxy NGC 4636 at a distance of 47 million light years, was observed to flare once. Five flares were detected from the other source, which is located near the galaxy NGC 5128 at a distance of 12 million light years.\n\nWhat could these objects be? Probably not magnetars, which are young neutron stars with powerful magnetic fields. Magnetars are also known to have giant X-ray flares, but they are different from these newly discovered objects in a few different ways including how long they flare and where they are found.\n\nWhile the nature of these flares is unknown, researchers have begun to search for answers. One idea is that the flares represent episodes when matter being pulled away from a companion star falls rapidly onto a black hole or neutron star. This could happen when the companion makes its closest approach to the compact object in an eccentric orbit. Another explanation could involve matter falling onto an intermediate-mass black hole, with a mass of about 800 times that of the Sun for one source and 80 times that of the Sun for the other.\n\nThese new flaring objects will likely keep both observational and theoretical astrophysicists busy for quite some time. Using telescopes like Chandra and XMM-Newton, they undoubtedly hope to come up with more answers soon.\n\nMore information at http:\/\/chandra.harvard.edu\/photo\/2016\/ngc5128\/","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":45,"publishedAt":"2017-01-20T16:54:52.000Z","title":"A Tour of NGC 5128 Flare","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/np855eaSES8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/np855eaSES8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/np855eaSES8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/np855eaSES8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"np855eaSES8"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"np855eaSES8","videoPublishedAt":"2016-11-21T22:00:02.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/73HQpuTpE67jGFFU1D7ustecL6w\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy44QjNCNkRENjNFQTBEMUND","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Each year, NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory helps celebrate American Archive Month by releasing a collection of images using X-ray data that have been stored in its archive.\n\nThe Chandra Data Archive is a sophisticated digital system that ultimately contains all of the data obtained by the telescope since its launch into space in 1999.

The largest, or supermassive, black holes can contain hundreds of thousands times the mass of the Sun up to billions of times its mass and typically reside in the centers of galaxies. Sometimes, however, astronomers find black holes in somewhat unusual places.\n\nTake, for example, the object known as XJ1417+52. First discovered in observations from Chandra and XMM-Newton over a decade ago, this object has some interesting properties. To begin with, astronomers think this object may fall right at the boundary between supermassive black holes and the intermediate-mass category. As their name suggest, the latter class are black holes of medium size in between stellar mass black holes and supermassive ones. X-rays from both Chandra and XMM-Newton show that XJ1417+52 gave off an extraordinary amount of X-rays. This and other pieces of evidence suggest that XJ1417+52 contains about 100,000 times the mass of the Sun.\n\nWhat makes this object even more interesting is its location. Rather than being in the center of its host galaxy, it is located on its northern edge. Astronomers think this could have happened when a smaller galaxy with XJ1417+52 at its center collided with a larger galaxy. Since these two galaxies are still in the process of merging, the two black holes have yet to coalesce into one bigger black hole, but may do so millions or billions of years from now. \n\nMore information at http:\/\/chandra.harvard.edu\/photo\/2016\/xj1417\/","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":47,"publishedAt":"2017-01-20T16:54:07.000Z","title":"A Tour of XJ1417+52","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eWtwsb_E8Hw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eWtwsb_E8Hw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eWtwsb_E8Hw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/eWtwsb_E8Hw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"eWtwsb_E8Hw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"eWtwsb_E8Hw","videoPublishedAt":"2016-11-16T21:30:00.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/MTM0T3A_pMi0bf5xzNDHzpAurUM\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy5CNEYyNTVBNDdGMDI1MDNC","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"During the summer of 2015, scientists and the public alike were treated to a flood of images and discoveries about Pluto as the New Horizon spacecraft made an unprecedented flyby of the dwarf planet. The discoveries about Pluto didn't stop with the initial results that were released. Rather, the New Horizons spacecraft will provide scientists with years worth of discoveries of this cold and distant world.\n\nWhile New Horizons is accomplishing much on its own, there is even more science to be uncovered when other telescopes join the effort. This is the case for X-ray observations of Pluto made by the Chandra X-ray Observatory as New Horizons made its approach and then flew by Pluto.\n\nThe Chandra data show that Pluto has surprisingly high amounts of X-ray emission for a cold and rocky planet that has no known significant magnetic field. While X-rays have been detected elsewhere in the Solar System -- including comets, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter - it appears that Pluto's X-rays are not generated in exactly the same way as these other objects. Rather, the researchers suggest that the X-rays from Pluto come from the interaction of gases in Pluto's atmosphere and the stream of particles from the Sun known as the solar wind. Scientists hope to learn more about Pluto and other objects in the outermost regions of our Solar System with future observations. \n\nMore information at http:\/\/chandra.si.edu\/photo\/2016\/pluto\/","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":48,"publishedAt":"2017-01-20T16:53:32.000Z","title":"Tour of Pluto","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jCiBI1I8D2o\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jCiBI1I8D2o\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jCiBI1I8D2o\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jCiBI1I8D2o\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"jCiBI1I8D2o"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"jCiBI1I8D2o","videoPublishedAt":"2016-11-12T21:00:02.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/njlotVz8LZLvTA7bu1I7S9R-Eso\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy41ODIyMTgwQzA4NjJCQkZC","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"When stars have more than about 8 times as much mass as the Sun, they end their lives in a spectacular explosion called a supernova. The outer layers of the star are hurtled out into space at millions of miles per hour, leaving a debris field of gas and dust. Where the star once was located, a small, incredibly dense object called a neutron star is often found. While only 10 miles or so across, the tightly packed neutrons in such a star contain more mass than the entire Sun.\n\nThe supernova remnant called RCW 103 is a by-product of one of these explosions and the neutron star it left behind, known as 1E 1613, is proving to be particularly interesting. For years, astronomers have known that 1E 1613 shows a regular brightening and dimming in its X-rays that repeats about every six and a half hours. It could be a neutron star that is rotating much more slowly than other neutron stars, or it could be a faster-spinning neutron star that has a normal star as a companion.\n\nNew data from four high-energy telescopes, Chandra, Swift, NuSTAR and XMM-Newton, have shown that the unusually slow spin is the correct explanation and that.1E 1613 has the properties of a magnetar. Magnetars are neutron stars that possess enormously powerful magnetic fields, trillions of times greater than that on the Sun.\n\nWhile it is still unclear why 1E 1613 is spinning so slowly, scientists do have some ideas. One leading scenario is that debris from the exploded star has fallen back onto magnetic field lines around the spinning neutron star, causing it to spin more slowly with time. Searches are currently being made for other very slowly spinning magnetars to study this idea in more detail.\n\n\nMore information at http:\/\/chandra.si.edu\/photo\/2016\/rcw103\/","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNICn94JL5Qq-hqz43vNtoBc","position":49,"publishedAt":"2017-01-20T16:53:13.000Z","title":"Tour of RCW 103","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vh7XGiNjEKo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vh7XGiNjEKo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vh7XGiNjEKo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vh7XGiNjEKo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"vh7XGiNjEKo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"vh7XGiNjEKo","videoPublishedAt":"2016-11-10T21:00:03.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/QEQf8Ndie-0E4kMXTTHwXrPnpxc\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSUNuOTRKTDVRcS1ocXo0M3ZOdG9CYy5FRjdGNDMzN0I2RTI3MDlG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"Galaxy clusters are incredibly important objects in the Universe since they are the largest objects in the Universe held together by gravity.

For as much as they already know about galaxy clusters, astronomers are still seeking to learn more. This includes learning about how galaxy clusters first formed in the early Universe.\n\nA new discovery by a team of researchers may represent an important step in that direction. Using NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory and several other telescopes on the ground and in space, researchers recently found a galaxy cluster that is about 11.1 billion light years from Earth. In addition to its remarkable distance, this cluster, known as CL J1001+0220, also displays some intriguing qualities. For example, astronomers find that the core of this cluster is ablaze with star formation. This is quite different from other galaxy clusters observed by astronomers, where star formation rates are very low. It may be that this galaxy cluster represents a brief, but important, stage of the evolution where a cluster transitions from a still-forming cluster into a mature one. Astronomers hope that they will learn a lot about the formation of clusters and the galaxies they contain by studying this object.\n\nMore information at
