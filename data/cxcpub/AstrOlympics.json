We see rotation all around us \u2013 a merry-go- round on a playground, a vinyl record on a turntable, even a washing machine that cleans our clothes. It can often be important \u2013 and interesting \u2013 to determine just how fast something spins. We call this rotational speed and it is measured as the number of rotations over a certain period of time.\n\nIn the Olympic Games, athletes often need to rotate in order to compete in their sports. Gymnasts rotate their bodies during routines, ice skaters rotate during their spins, and aerial skiers perform rotations high in the air. How do the spinning accomplishments of these amazing athletes compare to other rotating things that we know about?\n\nFerris wheels rotate about relatively slowly making one revolution every 600 seconds or so. A ceiling fan, on the other hand, typically rotates twice around every second. This translates into a rotational speed of 0.5 Hertz, the unit we use to talk about rotation. (Hertz=# of rotations per second). That is very quick, but a gymnast doing a back flip rotates with a speed of 1.5 Hertz, while an ice skater can spin with a rotational speed of 50 Hertz.\n\nWe also find things in space that rotate. For example, all of the planets, including Earth, rotate around an axis as they make their orbit around the Sun. This rotation, which happens once every 24 hours on Earth, gives us our day and night. The Sun also spins, making one rotation about every 25 days. Elsewhere in space, astronomers have found objects that rotate at a dizzying speed. For example, the dense cores left behind after stars explode \u2013 known as neutron stars \u2013 can rotate at remarkable rates. The neutron star at the center of the Crab Nebula is moving at 30 Hertz, in other words making 30 rotations in just one second. That\u2019s almost as fast as Olympic ice skaters, which is amazing especially when you consider that the neutron star is over 10 miles or 16 kilometers across!\n\nPerhaps the next time you watch a gymnast tumble or a skier do a flip, think of the other examples in our lives and across space where rotation is taking place.\n\nMore information at http:\/\/chandra.si.edu\/olympics","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNJgb_-BA99Y3agS57Azn68J","position":2,"publishedAt":"2017-01-27T14:20:46.000Z","title":"Astrolympics: Rotation","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aJ31O-Za-u0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aJ31O-Za-u0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aJ31O-Za-u0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aJ31O-Za-u0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/aJ31O-Za-u0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"aJ31O-Za-u0"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"aJ31O-Za-u0","videoPublishedAt":"2016-06-08T15:22:00.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/XmxH57wYbf8xEQrC7jML_zpkGKU\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSmdiXy1CQTk5WTNhZ1M1N0F6bjY4Si4wOTA3OTZBNzVEMTUzOTMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"The concept of speed is infused into our lives, whether it is as we run, drive a car, or travel across the globe. Of course, the athletes in the Olympic Games are often the fastest in the world. This is apparent in many of the Olympic sports from track and field to cycling to downhill skiing and speed skating.\n\u00a0\nWhile we are used to asking, \u2018who is faster,\u2019 it\u2019s important to understand just what speed represents. Speed is defined as a distance traveled over a certain period of time. In science, we would write this as the equation \"speed equals distance divided by time.\" We've become rather used to this equation \u2013 even if we don\u2019t realize it. Using this equation, for example, cars provide speed in miles or kilometers per hour. This gives the number of miles or kilometers that would be covered if you moved at that speed for one hour.\n\u00a0\nThe international standard unit for speed is different. The distance is measured in meters, while the amount of time considered is one second. By converting speeds from common experiences into meters per second, we can use this as a reference point for exploring the enormous range of speeds around the world and across the Universe.\n\u00a0\nFor example, a car moving at 20 miles per hour (or 32 kilometers per hour) is going the equivalent speed of about 9 meters per second. An Olympic athlete, however, can move even faster. Usain Bolt has been clocked running at 12.4 meters per second in the 100-meter sprint. And over a dozen cyclists at the velodrome at the 2012 London Games reached top speeds of over 20 meters per second.\n\u00a0\nThese are incredibly impressive feats of speed in the arena of athletic competitions. They also make the speeds found elsewhere even more amazing. For example, the speed of sound in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is about 340 meters per second. Meanwhile, the International Space Station orbits the Earth at about 7,600 meters per second, and the Earth travels around the Sun at some 30,000 meters per second.\u00a0\n\nThose blistering paces pale in comparison, however, to the Universe\u2019s real speedsters. Take, for example, the pulsar known as IGR J11014-6103. This dense core was created when a star collapsed, hurtling this object into space. Astronomers have calculated that this stellar nub is blazing away from its birthplace at a whopping one to two million meters per second. Now that\u2019s a speed that anyone -- Olympic athlete or otherwise -- might have to marvel at.\n\nMore information at http:\/\/chandra.si.edu\/olympics","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNJgb_-BA99Y3agS57Azn68J","position":3,"publishedAt":"2017-01-27T14:20:37.000Z","title":"Astrolympics: Speed","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/COhkMWr7aVU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/COhkMWr7aVU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/COhkMWr7aVU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/COhkMWr7aVU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"COhkMWr7aVU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"COhkMWr7aVU","videoPublishedAt":"2016-06-15T19:25:40.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/cndL8topDAuPB_byddVuuGwgxT0\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSmdiXy1CQTk5WTNhZ1M1N0F6bjY4Si41MjE1MkI0OTQ2QzJGNzNG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"We frequently ask: how far away is that? The concept of distance is very familiar to us. After all, we need to factor in distance whether it\u2019s for a trip around the corner or across the country. One way to define distance is the ground covered between two points.\n\u00a0\nDistance plays an important role in many Olympic sports. The ability to travel the distance around a track, across a swimming pool, or down the road faster than anyone else may lead to a gold medal. Olympic events like the marathon show how some athletes can excel over what most of us consider to be a very long distance.\n\u00a0\nDespite how large some Olympic distances may seem, they are just a tiny fraction of the lengths we see across space. For comparison purposes, let\u2019s look at everything in the widely accepted unit of meters. In the metric system, a kilometer simply means a thousand meters (which is equivalent to about 0.62 miles). The longest Olympic track and field event in terms of distance is the 50-kilometer, or 50,000-meter, race walk.\n\u00a0\nBy comparison, it is about 7700 kilometers, or 7.7 million meters, from New York to Rio de Janeiro for those athletes and spectators making that trip.\u00a0 The distance around the equator of Earth is about 40 million meters. In space, however, distances get much, much bigger. It\u2019s about 150 billion meters to the Sun, and 40 quadrillion meters to Proxima Centauri, the next nearest star to us. That\u2019s a 40 followed by another 15 zeroes.\n\u00a0\nBecause numbers get so large so quickly when talking about objects in space, astronomers most often use the unit of light years to describe distance. While it sounds like an amount of time, a light year is, in fact, a distance. It is equivalent to how far light travels over the course of one year, roughly 9,000 trillion meters. Rather than keeping track of all of those zeroes, we can measure that same distance to Proxima Centauri as being about 4.2 light years away. That\u2019s helpful because Proxima Centauri is actually very close to us, compared to many other things in space. For example, the center of the Milky Way galaxy is about 26,000 light years away. And astronomers have observed light left over from the Big Bang at some 13.7 billion light years away.\n\u00a0\nSo whether it is around a track or across a galaxy, distance is something worth keeping in perspective.\n\nMore information at http:\/\/chandra.si.edu\/olympics\/","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNJgb_-BA99Y3agS57Azn68J","position":4,"publishedAt":"2017-01-27T14:20:22.000Z","title":"Astrolympics: Distance","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2zvgd88rc_Q\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2zvgd88rc_Q\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2zvgd88rc_Q\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2zvgd88rc_Q\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"2zvgd88rc_Q"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"2zvgd88rc_Q","videoPublishedAt":"2016-08-16T23:40:54.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/WT63H59R62kbcB6mr-xofUjMZ5I\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSmdiXy1CQTk5WTNhZ1M1N0F6bjY4Si4wMTcyMDhGQUE4NTIzM0Y5","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"The concept of time permeates our lives. We keep track of time throughout our day on our clocks, phones, or other devices. In the Olympic Games, we use time to dictate how long events are held and to measure how fast athletes perform.   \n\nBut how do you actually define time? Time can be defined as the measurement of repeating patterns. For millennia, the pattern was the rising and setting of the Sun to define the day, and then motion of the Sun across the sky to track a year. Today, we have many mechanical means to generate a repeating pattern from the swinging of a pendulum to the behavior of electrons in so-called atomic clocks.\n\nWe need very accurate measurements for the closely contested events in the Olympics, where the difference between gold and silver can be a fraction of a second. However, everyday technologies like GPS require even more precision.  \n\nTime and our ability to measure it accurately is also key for many frontiers of science, including astrophysics. The Chandra X-ray Observatory has instruments on board that measure the arrival time of every photon of X-ray light from the objects in space it observes. This timing information can be crucial in learning about cosmic phenomena like how quickly a neutron star spins or how material swirls around a black hole.\n\nLet\u2019s look at some examples. Missy Franklin can cross 100 meters of a swimming pool doing the backstroke in less than 60 seconds. Gamma ray bursts that signal the birth of a black hole last about that long. In the race-walk event at the Olympics, the top athletes finish the 50-kilometer course in just over three and a half hours, or nearly 13,000 seconds. This is a little less time than it takes light from the Sun to reach Neptune. Of course, in the Universe, things can last much longer than that. Our Earth was formed about 4.5 billion years ago, while the Universe itself is thought to be about 13.8 billion years old. That\u2019s a lot of swings of a pendulum to be sure.\n\nMore information at http:\/\/chandra.si.edu\/olympics\/","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNJgb_-BA99Y3agS57Azn68J","position":5,"publishedAt":"2017-01-27T14:19:57.000Z","title":"Astrolympics: Time","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PbabDKAwFWQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PbabDKAwFWQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PbabDKAwFWQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PbabDKAwFWQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"PbabDKAwFWQ"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"PbabDKAwFWQ","videoPublishedAt":"2016-08-16T23:32:24.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/WpmTpj25OZ2Ir8W7xD000cDThBQ\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSmdiXy1CQTk5WTNhZ1M1N0F6bjY4Si4yODlGNEE0NkRGMEEzMEQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"During the Olympic Games, there is a lot of talk about pressure. Normally, people are referring to the mental stress and high expectations that athletes might feel during intense competitions.\n\nHowever, there are other kinds of pressure at play both in the Olympics and throughout our lives. In science, pressure is defined as the amount of force over a given area. This means you can have the same amount of force over two different areas and end up with different results.\n\nFor example, imagine you are walking along a snowy field in your boots. With each step you take, you sink into the snow. However, if you strap on snowshoes, you can walk without falling in. The change you made was to increase the area over which the weight, or force, was being spread. The increased area of the snowshoes compared to your boots has decreased the amount of pressure on the snow, allowing you to smoothly walk without penetrating the surface of the snow.\n\nThis concept of pressure is also present in many Olympic sports. Rowing is one event where force per area is very important. Once rowers place their oars into the water, they use the strength of their bodies to put as much force as they can onto the area covered by the oar\u2019s blades. Whichever boat can do this in the most synchronized fashion is likely to win the race.\n\nPressure can exist in solids, liquids, or gases, and we can measure it in objects found in space. The pressure found within the hot gas that permeates a galaxy cluster is very low, about seventeen more orders of magnitude (that is, zeroes beyond the decimal point) than what we find in human blood pressure. On the other hand, we also find cosmic objects that experience extremely high pressures such as in the interiors of neutron stars. In the cores of these collapsed dead stars, pressure can reach a million trillion trillion times that of the air pressure we experience here on the surface of the Earth.\n\nIn fact, pressure may have the greatest range of all physical variables, spanning over 60 orders of magnitude from the vacuum of space to the densest stellar cores in the Universe. Whether it is in the center of a star or at the center stage of the Olympics, pressure can be significant in many ways.\n\nMore info at http:\/\/chandra.si.edu\/olympics\/","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNJgb_-BA99Y3agS57Azn68J","position":6,"publishedAt":"2017-01-27T14:19:48.000Z","title":"Astrolympics: Pressure","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0K9JoBr1zM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0K9JoBr1zM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0K9JoBr1zM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0K9JoBr1zM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"O0K9JoBr1zM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"O0K9JoBr1zM","videoPublishedAt":"2016-08-17T20:39:38.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/6TIddt0lpiUXDHJEbHSERWL1mIs\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSmdiXy1CQTk5WTNhZ1M1N0F6bjY4Si41NkI0NEY2RDEwNTU3Q0M2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"How much does something weigh? This is an important question in everyday life, whether one is deciding to try to pick up a piece of furniture or add more resistance during a workout at the gym. However, the better question to ask may be, how much mass does that object contain?\n\nThe reason this change in vocabulary can be important is that mass refers to the amount of stuff in an object. Weight, on the other hand, is an object\u2019s mass multiplied by the acceleration caused by gravity. On the Earth\u2019s surface, there\u2019s a consistent tug from gravity. However, if you venture to other planets where gravitational forces are different or into space itself where gravity is virtually non-existent, then that object\u2019s weight will change.\n\nMass, however, does not change no matter what the environment. For example, the mass of 263 kg, which stands as the current Olympic record for the clean-and- jerk, is the same in Rio as it would be on the Moon. It might be harder to lift here on Earth with stronger gravity, but the mass of those plates and bar remains constant because it is an independent value.\n\nOn Earth, there are some pretty massive things. The mass of an automobile is about 1,000 to 2,000 kg, while the blue whale is estimated to have a mass of nearly 200,000 kilograms. Humans have gone even further, constructing structures of enormous mass. The Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco has the mass of about 380 million kg. That\u2019s pretty big to be sure, but things can get much, much bigger.\n\nHow do we get the mass of objects that we can\u2019t physically move or even touch? One way is to observe how much gravitational pull something exerts on other objects or vice versa. Astronomers use this technique to measure the mass of some really enormous things.\n\nOur planet Earth is 6 trillion trillion kilograms, which is a six followed by 24 zeroes. Our Sun is about a million times more massive than that, and the numbers keep going up. For example, the most massive cluster of galaxies in the early Universe that we know about is called El Gordo. Astronomers estimate that it contains the mass of some 3 million billion times the mass of our Sun.\n\nThe range of mass in our everyday lives and what we can appreciate in sporting events like the Olympics is just the tip of the proverbial iceberg \u2013 especially once we allow our minds to consider the wonders of space.\n\nMore info at http:\/\/chandra.si.edu\/olympics\/","playlistId":"PLkVRJfUnLRNJgb_-BA99Y3agS57Azn68J","position":7,"publishedAt":"2017-01-27T14:19:36.000Z","title":"Astrolympics: Mass","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JsWdhVdjB6k\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JsWdhVdjB6k\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JsWdhVdjB6k\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JsWdhVdjB6k\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"JsWdhVdjB6k"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"JsWdhVdjB6k","videoPublishedAt":"2016-08-17T20:45:38.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/37GW1cgqQTy38D1j8Z81gphcO44\"","id":"UExrVlJKZlVuTFJOSmdiXy1CQTk5WTNhZ1M1N0F6bjY4Si45NDk1REZENzhEMzU5MDQz","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCcvatGFnbYUCgXRapk1dMvw","channelTitle":"Chandra X-ray Observatory","description":"What do Olympic athletes and objects in space have in common?
