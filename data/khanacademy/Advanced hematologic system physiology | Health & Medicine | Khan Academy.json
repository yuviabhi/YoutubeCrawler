One reason may be that your heart helps you live, by moving ~5 liters (1.3 gallons) of blood through almost 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles) of blood vessels every single minute!

Learn about how the heart works, how blood flows through the heart, where the blood goes after it leaves the heart, and what your heart is doing when it makes the sound \u201cLub Dub.\u201d\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy is a nonprofit with a mission to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.
