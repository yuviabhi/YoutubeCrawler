Not only will you be a multi-digit addition and subtraction rockstar, but you'll extend the multiplication and division that you started in 3rd grade to several digits. You'll also discover that you sometimes have something left over (called a \"remainder\") when you divide. In 3rd grade you learned what a fraction is. Now you'll start adding, subtracting, multiplying, and comparing them. You'll also see how they relate to decimals. On other fronts, you'll learn how to convert between different units (which is super important when comparing the size and speed of robot unicorns in different countries) and continue your journey thinking about various shapes in two dimensions. Some of the foundational concepts of geometry (like lines, rays and angles) also get introduced. As always, we'll round this out with a healthy dose of applied word problems and explorations of number patterns and properties (including the ideas of factors, multiples and prime numbers). The fun must not stop!

This means that it not only has width and height, but it has depth as well. Let's watch this video in which we get a great explanation of how we measure volume.\n\nPractice this lesson yourself on KhanAcademy.org right now: https:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/math\/pre-algebra\/measurement\/volume-introduction-rectangular\/e\/volume_with_unit_cubes?utm_source=YT&utm_medium=Desc&utm_campaign=PreAlgebra\n\nWatch the next lesson: https:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/math\/pre-algebra\/measurement\/volume-introduction-rectangular\/v\/measuring-volume-with-unit-cubes?utm_source=YT&utm_medium=Desc&utm_campaign=PreAlgebra\n\nMissed the previous lesson?  https:\/\/www.khanacademy.org\/math\/pre-algebra\/measurement\/rectangle-area-perimeter-word-pr\/v\/comparing-area?utm_source=YT&utm_medium=Desc&utm_campaign=PreAlgebra\n\nPre-Algebra on Khan Academy: No way, this isn't your run of the mill arithmetic. This is Pre-algebra. You're about to play with the professionals. Think of pre-algebra as a runway. You're the airplane and algebra is your sunny vacation destination. Without the runway you're not going anywhere. Seriously, the foundation for all higher mathematics is laid with many of the concepts that we will introduce to you here: negative numbers, absolute value, factors, multiples, decimals, and fractions to name a few. So buckle up and move your seat into the upright position. We're about to take off!\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.\n\nFor free. For everyone.
