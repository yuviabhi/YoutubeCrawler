It's the most important skill we learn in our early years and becomes the foundation for all other math concepts. Once we can count, we can add, subtract, and measure the world around us. Shortly thereafter, we can learn about place values, plots, graphs, time, money, and shapes. These early math skills are presented in this subject's tutorials in a straightforward, understandable, and (dare we say it) fun way!\n\nWant a virtual coach for Early Math?

We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more. Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps.
