Then think algebra II and working with two variables in a single equation. Now generalize and combine these two mathematical concepts, and you begin to see some of what Multivariable calculus entails, only now include multi dimensional thinking. Typical concepts or operations may include: limits and continuity, partial differentiation, multiple integration, scalar functions, and fundamental theorem of calculus in multiple dimensions.\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more.
