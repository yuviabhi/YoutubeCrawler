Buerger disease is characterised by poor blood flow through blood vessels due to inflammation and blood clotting. Symptoms typically include pain (claudication), increased sensitivity to cold, diminished pulses, and cyanosis. Gangrene is often a complication which may require amputation of the affected area.

Buerger disease is characterised by poor blood flow through blood vessels due to inflammation and blood clotting. Symptoms typically include pain (claudication), increased sensitivity to cold, diminished pulses, and cyanosis. Gangrene is often a complication which may require amputation of the affected area. Learn how health care professionals diagnose Buerger disease using ultrasound and angiography.
