That's awesome! In 3rd grade math we want you to start using bigger numbers and start multiplying and dividing, too. By the way, did you know that some numbers aren\u2019t actually \u201cwhole?\u201d They\u2019re \u201cpartially whole.\u201d We call them fractions! We want you to start playing around and having fun with those, too. There's also area, perimeter, and place value to be discovered. Whew. We have so much to do and can't wait to do it with you.
