We\u2019re entering a MacArthur Foundation competition, called 100&Change, for a $100 million grant to help solve a critical problem of our time. Millions of people lack the skills and credentials to participate in the global economy. To address this, our long-term goal is to develop internationally-recognized diplomas that provide direct access to economic and educational opportunities. We also plan to create free content and tools to help people earn the diplomas. If we win the grant, we\u2019ll be able to accelerate the development of the diplomas, content, and tools. We want to connect people to real economic opportunity and unlock human potential for generations to come. If you believe in our vision, please share our video and comment below.\n\nPROBLEM STATEMENT\n\nToo many people lack the skills and credentials to participate meaningfully in the global economy. This is caused by problems at every stage of our education pipeline, from inadequate school access to low graduation rates. The United Nations estimates that 263 million children, including half of all refugee children, are not in school. In the United States alone, 55% of college students never earn a diploma. These challenges will be exacerbated in the near term by the global refugee crisis and in the long term by automation as new industries are created and old jobs made obsolete.\n\nFor many of the millions shut out of the modern economy, like girls in oppressive societies, laid-off workers, refugees, and prisoners, traditional routes to employment are out of reach. Cost, time constraints, and social barriers limit access. Even those with degrees are often underemployed, as curricula are disconnected from employers\u2019 needs. Online learning materials are becoming widely accessible, but they are not yet connected directly to economic empowerment.\n\nThere have been many attempts to address aspects of this problem, but the solutions are often piecemeal, hard to scale, expensive, or locale-specific.\n\nSolving this problem is imperative for millions who want a better life for themselves and their families; for employers, who need an increasingly skilled entry-level workforce; for educational institutions, who want to help more people achieve their potential; and for society at large, as disenfranchisement and underemployment breed discontent, instability, and extremism.\n\nSOLUTION STATEMENT\n\nWe plan to develop\u200b internationally-recognized diplomas that provide direct access to economic and educational opportunities. To support this, we will create free content and tools to help people earn our diplomas at their own pace, regardless of their incoming skills. \n\nAn Afghan girl forbidden by the Taliban from attending school will now be able to study on her mobile phone, gain admission to a top university, and become a physicist. A father in Detroit who dropped out of high school will demonstrate his skills and work ethic to earn an entry-level job that supports his family. A school leader in Kenya will use these resources to ensure her students receive a rigorous education with international relevance. \n\nKhan Academy is already used by more than 100 million people around the world every year. These diplomas will connect current and future Khan Academy learners, including those in underserved communities and war-torn regions, to real economic opportunities.\n\nWe will develop the diplomas in close partnership with educational institutions and employers to ensure relevance. In addition to academic skills, we will recognize metacognitive skills, like perseverance, not measured by traditional degrees. Unlike other offerings, we will track job placement and performance to measure the efficacy of the diplomas and continuously improve them. Tools will enable teachers and mentors to track learners\u2019 progress and provide support. The initial release will be available in several major languages. \n\nTogether, we can unlock the potential of hundreds of millions of people for generations to come.","playlistId":"PL20CEC80FE46830DE","position":21,"publishedAt":"2016-10-01T22:53:53.000Z","title":"Khan Academy\u2019s 100&Change proposal: World-class diplomas for anyone,

Think of it as a shorthand, of sorts. As opposed to having to do something over and over again, algebra gives you a simple way to express that repetitive process. It's also seen as a \"gatekeeper\" subject. Once you achieve an understanding of algebra, the higher-level math subjects become accessible to you. Without it, it's impossible to move forward. It's used by people with lots of different jobs, like carpentry, engineering, and fashion design. In these tutorials, we'll cover a lot of ground. Some of the topics include linear equations, linear inequalities, linear functions, systems of equations, factoring expressions, quadratic expressions, exponents, functions, and ratios.\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy is a nonprofit with a mission to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.

Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride. We bet you're going to be challenged AND love it!\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

One reason may be that your heart helps you live, by moving ~5 liters (1.3 gallons) of blood through almost 100,000 kilometers (62,000 miles) of blood vessels every single minute! It has to do this all day, everyday, without ever taking a vacation! Now that is true love. Learn about how the heart works, how blood flows through the heart, where the blood goes after it leaves the heart, and what your heart is doing when it makes the sound \u201cLub Dub.\u201d\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy is a nonprofit with a mission to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.

Did you check the weather forecast? Busted! Did you decide to go through the drive through lane vs walk in? Busted again! We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics. So buckle up and hop on for a wild ride.

Don't be fooled. Looking at the prefix, tri-, you could probably assume that trigonometry (\"trig\" as it's sometimes called) has something to do with triangles. You would be right! Trig is the study of the properties of triangles. Why is it important? It's used in measuring precise distances, particularly in industries like satellite systems and sciences like astronomy. It's not only space, however. Trig is present in architecture and music, too. Now you may wonder...how is knowing the measurement and properties of triangles relevant to music?? THAT is a great question.

You would be right, of course, but that definition doesn't mean anything unless you have some knowledge of what calculus is. Let's keep it simple, shall we? Calculus is a conceptual framework which provides systematic techniques for solving problems. These problems are appropriately applicable to analytic geometry and algebra. Therefore....precalculus gives you the background for the mathematical concepts, problems, issues and techniques that appear in calculus, including trigonometry, functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and others.

We are constantly creating hypotheses, making predictions, testing, and analyzing. Our lives are full of probabilities! Statistics is related to probability because much of the data we use when determining probable outcomes comes from our understanding of statistics. In these tutorials, we will cover a range of topics, some which include: independent events, dependent probability, combinatorics, hypothesis testing, descriptive statistics, random variables, probability distributions, regression, and inferential statistics.
