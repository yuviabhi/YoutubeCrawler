This video outlines the first step in making our digital camera work in the Bit-zee robot. The required voltage for the camera was determined by adding the1.5 volt AAA batteries (there are three of them) together to get 4.5 volts (because the batteries are wired in series). Since new batteries usually have a voltage that exceeds their marked rating the camera can easily run on the 5 volts that the center terminal of our L298 motor controller provides.
