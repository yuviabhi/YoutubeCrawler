Our math missions guide learners from kindergarten to calculus using state-of-the-art, adaptive technology that identifies strengths and learning gaps. We've also partnered with institutions like NASA, The Museum of Modern Art, The California Academy of Sciences, and MIT to offer specialized content.\n\nFor free. For everyone. Forever. #YouCanLearnAnything\n\nSubscribe to Khan Academy\u2019s Geometry channel:\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/channel\/UCD3OtKxPRUFw8kzYlhJXa1Q?sub_confirmation=1\nSubscribe to Khan Academy: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/subscription_center?add_user=khanacademy","playlistId":"PLFE3A143757536D07","position":15,"publishedAt":"2009-01-05T01:49:08.000Z","title":"CA Geometry: Circle area chords tangent | Worked examples | Geometry | Khan Academy","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FJIZPvE3O1A\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FJIZPvE3O1A\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FJIZPvE3O1A\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FJIZPvE3O1A\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FJIZPvE3O1A\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"FJIZPvE3O1A"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"FJIZPvE3O1A","videoPublishedAt":"2009-01-05T01:20:54.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/uUGxTsuRMzA5VjsrO1hO5Fs7xyA\"","id":"UExGRTNBMTQzNzU3NTM2RDA3LjQwRDIxMTA0NjQ2MEU1N0Q=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UC4a-Gbdw7vOaccHmFo40b9g","channelTitle":"Khan Academy","description":"76-80, secants and graph translations","playlistId":"PLFE3A143757536D07","position":16,"publishedAt":"2009-01-05T01:49:08.000Z","title":"CA Geometry: Secants and Translations","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Mp838qprwyY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Mp838qprwyY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Mp838qprwyY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"Mp838qprwyY"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"Mp838qprwyY","videoPublishedAt":"2009-01-05T01:25:53.000Z"}}]}
