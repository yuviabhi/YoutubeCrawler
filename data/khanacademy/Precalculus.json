You would be right, of course, but that definition doesn't mean anything unless you have some knowledge of what calculus is. Let's keep it simple, shall we? Calculus is a conceptual framework which provides systematic techniques for solving problems. These problems are appropriately applicable to analytic geometry and algebra. Therefore....precalculus gives you the background for the mathematical concepts, problems, issues and techniques that appear in calculus, including trigonometry, functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and others. There you have it ladies and gentlemen....an introduction to precalculus!\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy is a nonprofit with a mission to provide a free, world-class education for anyone, anywhere.

In algebra 2 we build upon that foundation and not only extend our knowledge of algebra 1, but slowly become capable of tackling the BIG questions of the universe. We'll again touch on systems of equations, inequalities, and functions...but we'll also address exponential and logarithmic functions, logarithms, imaginary and complex numbers, conic sections, and matrices. Don't let these big words intimidate you. We're on this journey with you!\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.

You would be right, of course, but that definition doesn't mean anything unless you have some knowledge of what calculus is. Let's keep it simple, shall we? Calculus is a conceptual framework which provides systematic techniques for solving problems. These problems are appropriately applicable to analytic geometry and algebra. Therefore....precalculus gives you the background for the mathematical concepts, problems, issues and techniques that appear in calculus, including trigonometry, functions, complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and others. There you have it ladies and gentlemen....an introduction to precalculus!\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom.
