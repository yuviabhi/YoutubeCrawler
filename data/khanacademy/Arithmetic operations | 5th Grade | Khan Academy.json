You will deepen your knowledge of the decimals that you were first exposed to in 4th grade. In particular, you'll learn to do all the arithmetic operations--addition, subtraction, multiplication, division--with them and really understand what a decimal represents. This will be complemented by building your fraction muscles where you'll learn to add, subtract, and multiply any fractions (and begin to divide them). On the measurement front, you'll explore volume (or how much \"space\" something takes up) and continue the unit conversion journey begun in 4th grade. 5th grade is also the first time that you get exposed to the fundamental concept of graphing points on a coordinate plane, and you'll get a very brief exposure to the concept of exponents (when exploring \"powers\" of 10)! (Content was selected for this grade level based on a typical curriculum in the United States.)\n\nAbout Khan Academy: Khan Academy offers practice exercises, instructional videos, and a personalized learning dashboard that empower learners to study at their own pace in and outside of the classroom. We tackle math, science, computer programming, history, art history, economics, and more.

This will be complemented by building your fraction muscles where you'll learn to add, subtract, and multiply any fractions (and begin to divide them). On the measurement front, you'll explore volume (or how much \"space\" something takes up) and continue the unit conversion journey begun in 4th grade. 5th grade is also the first time that you get exposed to the fundamental concept of graphing points on a coordinate plane, and you'll get a very brief exposure to the concept of exponents (when exploring \"powers\" of 10)!
