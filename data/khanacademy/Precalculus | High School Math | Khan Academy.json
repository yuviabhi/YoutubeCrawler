In algebra 2 we build upon that foundation and not only extend our knowledge of algebra 1, but slowly become capable of tackling the BIG questions of the universe. We'll again touch on systems of equations, inequalities, and functions...but we'll also address exponential and logarithmic functions, logarithms, imaginary and complex numbers, conic sections, and matrices.

Don't be fooled. Looking at the prefix, tri-, you could probably assume that trigonometry (\"trig\" as it's sometimes called) has something to do with triangles. You would be right! Trig is the study of the properties of triangles. Why is it important? It's used in measuring precise distances, particularly in industries like satellite systems and sciences like astronomy. It's not only space, however. Trig is present in architecture and music, too. Now you may wonder...how is knowing the measurement and properties of triangles relevant to music?? THAT is a great question.
