This type of jetpack could be operated hands free so that astronauts can then use their hands to do other activities and perform work on the exterior of spacecraft.","playlistId":"PL2aBZuCeDwlSaZvSZmxeWwn2ANlEPj7Ju","position":12,"publishedAt":"2012-09-14T19:44:33.000Z","title":"NASA 2012 Hispanic Heritage Month Profile - Pedro Curiel    Johnson Space Center","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GC9C5DhZuk8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GC9C5DhZuk8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GC9C5DhZuk8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GC9C5DhZuk8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GC9C5DhZuk8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"GC9C5DhZuk8"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"GC9C5DhZuk8","videoPublishedAt":"2012-09-14T19:06:58.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/0QkuBzYjy8nS1tHuR0AGdO8AN38\"","id":"UEwyYUJadUNlRHdsU2FadlNabXhlV3duMkFObEVQajdKdS4xMkVGQjNCMUM1N0RFNEUx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCLA_DiR1FfKNvjuUpBHmylQ","channelTitle":"NASA","description":"Cassandra Rodriquez is an Operations Support Officer (OSO) in the International Space Station Flight Control Room at Johnson Space Center's Mission Control.
