Among the research it will deliver to the station is the Cold Atom Lab (CAL), a facility to create a spot ten billion times colder than the vacuum of space, which could help answer some big questions in modern physics. Zaiput Flow Technologies will seek to validate a liquid-liquid separator to enhance flow chemistry production in space. Researchers from Penn State University are sending an experiment to investigate and understand the complex process of cement solidification, which could address the high priority need for lightweight space structures for habitats that protect crew members. A fleet of CubeSats spanning everything from Earth science to educational outreach is also heading to the orbiting laboratory for deployment into low-Earth orbit.","playlistId":"PL2aBZuCeDwlQmiehqI9pygW757q1CyQu8","position":3,"publishedAt":"2018-06-28T19:01:13.000Z","title":"Orbital ATK CRS-9 Mission to the Space Station: What's On Board?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kvgDOLHu7Uo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kvgDOLHu7Uo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kvgDOLHu7Uo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kvgDOLHu7Uo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kvgDOLHu7Uo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"kvgDOLHu7Uo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"kvgDOLHu7Uo","videoPublishedAt":"2018-05-24T08:12:58.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/fmpuvX3mTXTuA5DOq_V7wvALJdw\"","id":"UEwyYUJadUNlRHdsUW1pZWhxSTlweWdXNzU3cTFDeVF1OC4wOTA3OTZBNzVEMTUzOTMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCLA_DiR1FfKNvjuUpBHmylQ","channelTitle":"NASA","description":"Our astronauts doing work outside the space station, an agencywide town hall with our new administrator, and old data provide new insight about Jupiter\u2019s moon Europa \u2013 a few of the stories to tell you about \u2013 This Week at NASA!\n\nThis video is available for download from NASA's Image and Video Library: https:\/\/images.nasa.gov\/details-NHQ_2018_0518_Astronauts%20Working%20Outside%20the%20Space%20Station%20on%20This%20Week%20@NASA%20%E2%80%93%20May%2018,%202018.html","playlistId":"PL2aBZuCeDwlQmiehqI9pygW757q1CyQu8","position":4,"publishedAt":"2018-06-28T19:01:29.000Z","title":"Astronauts Working Outside the Space Station on This Week @NASA \u2013 May 18, 2018","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qWE6D8nE8RY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qWE6D8nE8RY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qWE6D8nE8RY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qWE6D8nE8RY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qWE6D8nE8RY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"qWE6D8nE8RY"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"qWE6D8nE8RY","videoPublishedAt":"2018-05-18T20:10:49.000Z"}}]}
