That same day in a blog post, NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden and John Holdren, assistant to the President for Science and Technology, discussed two NASA initiatives that build on the president\u2019s vision and use public-private partnerships to enable humans to live and work in space in a sustainable way. The first was the selection of six companies to develop habitation systems as part of the agency\u2019s Next Space Technologies for Exploration Partnerships or \u201cNextSTEP\u201d program, designed to lay the groundwork for deep space missions. And this fall as part of the second initiative, NASA will start the process of providing companies with a potential opportunity to add their own modules and other capabilities to the International Space Station.

Today, with Apollo 11 as inspiration, NASA is taking the steps needed for America's next giant leap, to send astronauts to Mars. The path to Mars will use a stepping stone approach consisting of key elements, including human health and technology research aboard the International Space Station; development and evolution of NASA's Space Launch System rocket and Orion deep space capsule and development of other game-changing technologies to enable tomorrow's missions.

If the tests are successful, plans call for Dragon to move close enough to be grappled by the station's robotic arm and berthed to the orbiting laboratory. The flight is the first commercial venture to the ISS. Meanwhile, the three newest residents of the International Space Station were greeted by their Expedition 31 crewmates after their Soyuz capsule docked safely with the orbiting laboratory following its two day-plus journey from Kazakhstan.
