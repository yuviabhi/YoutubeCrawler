Throughout the universe there is a driving tendency for entropy to increase and free energy to be used up; however, sometimes there is some sort of barrier holding back further potential increase in entropy - these entropically favored but not directly possible reactions (like hydrogen nuclei fusing to become helium, or carbon dioxide reacting with hydrogen to form methane and water), *can* be achieved by larger systems, often complex or complicated, that allow multi-step reaction chains that ultimately lead to the entropically favored state. These systems, (stars, whose nuclei foster conditions amenable to fusion of hydrogen into helium, and life, which fosters conditions amenable to hydrogenating carbon dioxide) are naturally entropically favored, once they arise. And thus the purpose of both life, and stars, can be seen, in the context of the universe, as being a catalyst system that helps facilitate increases in entropy that are not otherwise possible.\n\nMusic for the series was especially composed by Nathaniel Schroeder, http:\/\/www.soundcloud.com\/drschroeder\n\nREFERENCES & ADDITIONAL INFORMATION\n\nHow Life Arose (Hydrogenating CO2 quote): https:\/\/blogs.scientificamerican.com\/observations\/how-life-arose-on-earth-and-how-a-singularity-might-bring-it-down\/\n\n\nSean\u2019s blog on this topic: https:\/\/www.preposterousuniverse.com\/blog\/2010\/03\/10\/free-energy-and-the-meaning-of-life\/\n\n\nMichael Russell article: http:\/\/science.sciencemag.org\/content\/302\/5645\/580.summary\n\n\nThe molecular formula for Fructose: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Fructose\n\n\nAdenosine Triphosphate (aka ATP): https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Adenosine_triphosphate\n\n\n\n\nHydrogen Fusion Reaction Chain: http:\/\/hyperphysics.phy-astr.gsu.edu\/hbase\/nucene\/fusion.html \nRichard Pogge (Ohio State University) on Stellar evolution: http:\/\/www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu\/~pogge\/Ast162\/Unit2\/lowmass.html \nStellar evolution lecture notes: http:\/\/astro.physics.uiowa.edu\/~kaaret\/s09\/L14_starsevolve.pdf\nStellar evolution wikipedia: https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Stellar_evolution \n\nSean's blog: http:\/\/www.preposterousuniverse.com\/blog\/2016\/05\/11\/big-picture-part-four-complexity\/\n\nSean Carroll: The Big Picture\n(more great articles about entropy, etc on his blog http:\/\/preposterousuniverse.com)\n\n\n\nMinutePhysics is on Google+ - http:\/\/bit.ly\/qzEwc6 \nAnd facebook - http:\/\/facebook.com\/minutephysics\nAnd twitter - @minutephysics\n\nMinute Physics provides an energetic and entertaining view of old and new problems in physics -- all in a minute!\n\nCreated by Henry Reich","playlistId":"PLoaVOjvkzQtyZF-2VpJrxPz7bxK_p1Dd2","position":4,"publishedAt":"2016-11-12T00:34:21.000Z","title":"What is the Purpose of Life?
