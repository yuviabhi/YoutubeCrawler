She looks at how it is spreading across the globe, why we need to urgently change our attitude towards antimicrobials, in particular antibiotics, so that we treat them as a common good \u2013 not only in health but also in agriculture, farming, aquaculture and the environment. \n\nAntimicrobials are a wonder drug, but only when used effectively. If we do not learn how to look after them, we could see a return to \u2018pre-antibiotic era\u2019 where 40% mortality is due to infections \u2013 something that is difficult to believe now.\n\nDame Sally Davies is the Chief Medical Officer of the UK, acting as the UK government\u2019s principal medical adviser and the professional head of all directors of public health in local government.\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZxEvWydldVLllk_bA8_rs2a","position":0,"publishedAt":"2017-11-01T16:08:07.000Z","title":"Antimicrobial Resistance: The End of Modern Medicine? with Dame Sally Davies","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2H_Ox1vVnTc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2H_Ox1vVnTc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2H_Ox1vVnTc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2H_Ox1vVnTc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/2H_Ox1vVnTc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"2H_Ox1vVnTc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"2H_Ox1vVnTc","videoPublishedAt":"2017-03-08T16:55:58.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/GF1EkRv5M4OefYh5VqZQRJmVMhE\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeEV2V3lkbGRWTGxsa19iQThfcnMyYS41NkI0NEY2RDEwNTU3Q0M2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Pankaj Chandak goes on a journey through the history of surgery, from the first antiseptics to medical robots.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nJoin award-winning surgeon and researcher Pankaj Chandak on a journey of medical innovation, from the first antiseptics of Joseph Lister to surgical robots.

How do antibiotics work? And what can we do about increasing antibiotic resistance? Jenny Rohn, scientist and novelist, investigates the fascinating world of bacteria in this Friday Evening Discourse event from the Ri.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nBacteria are our ancient enemies, evolving ever more clever ways of outmanoeuvring our natural defences and scientific technologies. For millennia, a simple cut or cough could kill. With the development of antibiotics, it seemed we would reign supreme.\n\nBut now the bacteria are again gaining ground.\n\nWith antibiotic resistance on the rise, and the development of new drugs having stagnated for decades, we humans might be in a lot of trouble very soon. Why are bacteria so insidious, what tricks do they employ to get the upper hand, and what can we do to stop them? Join Dr Jenny Rohn to explore these questions.\n\nDr Jenny Rohn received a BA in Biology from Oberlin College, Ohio, where she developed an interest in viruses and cancer before moving to the University of Washington for her PhD research into the evolution of feline leukaemia virus.\n\nAfter working as a researcher at Cancer Research UK and working in the biotechology industry in The Netherlands, Jenny gained a Wellcome Trust fellowship to study cell shape and architecture at University College London. She is now head of a cell biology lab where she studies how the cells of our body interact with invading bacteria.\n\nThis event took place at the Royal Institution on Friday 30 January.\n\nFind out about more events taking place at the Royal Institution in London: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/whats-on\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZxEvWydldVLllk_bA8_rs2a","position":4,"publishedAt":"2017-11-02T16:25:25.000Z","title":"Bacteria and Antibiotics: Revenge of the Microbes","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nmGaq9DsUfo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nmGaq9DsUfo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nmGaq9DsUfo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nmGaq9DsUfo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nmGaq9DsUfo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"nmGaq9DsUfo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"nmGaq9DsUfo","videoPublishedAt":"2015-03-04T10:10:14.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Ib7UnIhf_KQrLUQoOwt8ZPPaXZA\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeEV2V3lkbGRWTGxsa19iQThfcnMyYS5GNjNDRDREMDQxOThCMDQ2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"World War I drove great advances in science and technology, but less well-known is its impact on medicine.

But what is a drug? And who is it that should decide what a drug is?\n\nIn this Ri event chaired by Kate Kelland, EMEA Health and Science Correspondent for Reuters, Sharon Ruston and David Nutt explore the past, present and future of our societal and political attitudes towards drugs. From supposedly \"medical\" experimentations in the 18th and 19th centuries, to modern-day government drugs policy and the rise of new 'legal highs'.\n\nIn the 1800s, eminent Ri scientist Humphry Davy carried out numerous experiments on the effects of breathing nitrous oxide, testing it on both himself and others. These experiences lead to his claim that this drug could \"destroy our pains and increase our pleasures\". Comparing Davy's trials with those of Thomas De Quincey with opium, Sharon Ruston, Professor of Romanticism at Lancaster University, explores what were clearly some rather blurred boundaries between medical and recreational drug use at this time. Both nitrous oxide and opium have become invaluable medicines, the first as an anaesthetic, the second as morphine -- one of our most powerful forms of pain relief. But it seems during these early experimentations that these drugs' were heralded as much for their pleasurable uses as for the control of pain, enabling humans to access a new world of \"sublime perception\".\n\nSuch research was aided by the fact that, in Davy's day, science had little, if any, interference from politics. Times have certainly changed, and the use and classification of drugs has become heavily entrenched in politics. In the second half of the talk psychiatrist and neuropsychopharmacologist Prof David Nutt, explores this complex relationship, considering the challenges posed by politics, media and the alcohol industry in the future of drugs policy. Nutt raises some controversial questions, including whether alcohol is more dangerous than other drugs, and gives his thoughts on what drugs, and society's view of them, will look like in the future.\n\nYou can watch the Q&A from the event here: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Lyc5Eyw8SoA\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZxEvWydldVLllk_bA8_rs2a","position":6,"publishedAt":"2017-11-06T10:19:45.000Z","title":"Drugs, science and society; past, present and future","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qUNzoa991g4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qUNzoa991g4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qUNzoa991g4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qUNzoa991g4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qUNzoa991g4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"qUNzoa991g4"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"qUNzoa991g4","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-20T14:36:53.000Z"}}]}
