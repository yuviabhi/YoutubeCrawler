These ripples in space-time - 'Gravitational waves' - are produced by some of the most energetic and dramatic phenomena in our universe, including black holes, neutron stars and supernovae.\n\nClose to 100 years after the prediction of the existence of gravitational waves, the advanced detectors of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) recently detected such signals for the first time, starting a new era in astronomy. Sheila Rowan explains the nature of gravitational waves, describes what sources out in the Universe can produce them, explains how they are detected and what the future of this new era in astronomy might look like.\n\nSheila Rowan is a professor in the School of Physics and Astronomy at University of Glasgow.

Biology is, at its most basic, chemistry, and chemistry is built on the rules of quantum mechanics in the way atoms and molecules behave and fit together. \n\nAs Jim explains, biologists have until recently been dismissive of counter-intuitive aspects of the theory and feel it to be unnecessary, preferring their traditional ball-and-stick models of the molecular structures of life. Likewise, physicists have been reluctant to venture into the messy and complex world of the living cell - why should they when they can test their theories far more cleanly in the controlled environment of the physics lab?\n\nBut now, experimental techniques in biology have become so sophisticated that the time is ripe for testing ideas familiar to quantum physicists. Can quantum phenomena in the subatomic world impact the biological level and be present in living cells or processes - from the way proteins fold or genes mutate and the way plants harness light in photosynthesis to the way some birds navigate using the Earth's magnetic field? All appear to utilise what Jim terms \"the weirdness of the quantum world\".\n\nThe discourse explores multiple theories of quantum mechanics, from superposition to quantum tunnelling, and reveals why \"the most powerful theory in the whole of science\" remains incredibly mysterious. Plus, watch out for a fantastic explanation of the famous double slit experiment. \n\nWatch this video on the Ri Channel with additional learning materials:\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/X826sE\n\nFriday Evening Discourses\n\nThe tradition of Friday evening discourses at the Royal Institution was started by Michael Faraday in 1825. Since that time most major scientific figures have spoken in the famous Lecture Theatre at the heart of the Ri building at 21 Albemarle Street. Notable talks include Faraday announcing the existence of the technology of photography in 1839 and J.J. Thomson announcing the existence of the fundamental particle later called the electron in 1897.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZzxswBf5WhzbIDTInJOgCIP","position":38,"publishedAt":"2017-11-06T10:24:58.000Z","title":"Jim Al-Khalili - Quantum Life: How Physics Can Revolutionise Biology","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"wwgQVZju1ZM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"wwgQVZju1ZM","videoPublishedAt":"2013-01-30T14:48:07.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/UvDWrA70-3tGW04xH7WcFX91gWs\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaenhzd0JmNVdoemJJRFRJbkpPZ0NJUC5GNjAwN0Y0QTFGOTVDMEMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"It was the universe's most elusive particle, the linchpin for everything scientists dreamed up to explain how stuff works.
