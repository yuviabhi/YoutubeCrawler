What use is such a simple-sounding law? And how can it be used to smash glass? Chemical engineer Valeska Ting explains in the first film from our 2016 advent calendar, all about thermodynamics.\n\nVisit the online advent calendar: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/advent?utm_source=youtube&utm_medium=social&utm_campaign=201612_channel_advent\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe first, second and third laws of thermodynamics get all the glory. They\u2019re the most well known and frequently mentioned. But underpinning them all is a final law so fundamental that, although it was established last, had to be moved to the front of the list: the zeroth law. In the first film of our 2016 advent calendar, chemical engineer Valeska Ting explores the zeroth law of thermodynamics.\n\nThe zeroth law is essentially an observation: if two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in equilibrium with each other. This seemingly simple mantra is essential to our concept of temperature, as Valeska, armed with some very hot glasses, explains. \n\nOur 2016 advent calendar explores the four laws of thermodynamics through 24 short films, released daily in the run up to Christmas. We\u2019ll have explosive demonstrations, unique animations and even a musical number.

A evolving negotiation over toy blocks between a mother and son comes together to illustrate the first law of thermodynamics. \n\nThere are many ways to describe the first law of thermodynamics, and many ways to explain it. In this unique animation, chemist Andrea Sella recalls one of Richard Feynman\u2019s descriptions of the law. In a classic analogy, Feynman imagines a child with a set of building blocks, and a mother struggling to ensure he doesn\u2019t lose any. Each day, the total number of blocks remains the same, although some do stray from their original location. \n\nThis consistent fact \u2013 that the blocks cannot be created or destroyed \u2013 allows the mother to calculate how many blocks are in a box without even looking. And this consistent fact, that energy itself is also always conserved, lays the foundation for one of physics\u2019 greatest rules.\n\nThe 2016 advent calendar explores the four laws of thermodynamics with a new short film each day, with explosive demonstrations, unique animations, and even a musical number.

In this animation, particle accelerator physicist Suzie Sheehydiscusses why the first law of thermodynamics is so important to particle physics.\n\nTo describe the motion of almost any system, from a car on a road to particles in an accelerator, you have to be able to trust that certain quantities are conserved. From the simple rule that energy is conserved, you can deduct incredible information.\n\nIn a particle accelerator, particles are collided with each other, or with other matter. The result is a spray of the component particles, but some of these can\u2019t be detected by modern machines. For example, neutrinos have almost no mass and as such are almost impossible to directly detect. But because energy is always conserved, the physicists can tell what properties they haven\u2019t detected by calculating the difference between the initial input and the output they find.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics gives a predictive power that lets scientists understand the world.\n\nThis video was supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council.\n\nThe 2016 advent calendar explores the four laws of thermodynamics with a new short film each day, with explosive demonstrations, unique animations, and even a musical number.
