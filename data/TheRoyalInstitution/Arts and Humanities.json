Carlo Rovelli brings together physics, philosophy and art to unravel the mystery of time.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nWatch the Q&A: https:\/\/youtu.be\/FIgYmNYXMas\n\nTime is a mystery that does not cease to puzzle us. Philosophers, artists and poets have long explored its meaning while scientists have found that its structure is different from the simple intuition we have of it. Time flows at a different speed in different places, the past and the future differ far less than we might think, and the very notion of the present evaporates in the vast universe.\n\nCarlo Rovelli is a theoretical physicist who has made significant contributions to the physics of space and time. He has worked in Italy and the US, and is currently directing the quantum gravity research group of the Centre de physique th\u00e9orique in Marseille, France. His books 'Seven Brief Lessons on Physics' and 'Reality Is Not What It Seems' are international bestsellers translated into forty-one languages.\n\nThis talk and Q&A was filmed in the Ri on 30 April 2018.\n\n---\nThank you for our Patreon supporters who help us make more videos like this:\nAlan Delos Santos, Ashok Bommisetti, Greg Nagel, Lester Su, Rebecca Pan and Will Knott.\n---\n\nThe Ri is on Patreon: https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/TheRoyalInstitution\nand Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwuobpo4woijziWmW73DixG","position":0,"publishedAt":"2018-06-13T14:02:09.000Z","title":"The Physics and Philosophy of Time - with Carlo Rovelli","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-6rWqJhDv7M\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-6rWqJhDv7M\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-6rWqJhDv7M\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-6rWqJhDv7M\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-6rWqJhDv7M\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"-6rWqJhDv7M"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"-6rWqJhDv7M","videoPublishedAt":"2018-06-13T14:02:09.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/6gK6ZNaQmDU3kTIGKfmT_hXuGVk\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad3VvYnBvNHdvaWp6aVdtVzczRGl4Ry4zRjM0MkVCRTg0MkYyQTM0","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"What will the world of tomorrow be like?
