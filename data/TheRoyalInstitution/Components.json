As Cambridge University Ph.D student Hilary Costello explains, her experiments need recording and validating with data.\n\nWithout placing sensors on the tether itself how can the dynamics of a string down its full length over time be recorded? To test out a solution she heads out to brave the elements with Masters student Richard Shaw.\n\nThe pair position two stills cameras at different angles to the line and with a shared trigger shoot simultaneous pictures at one frame per second. These images are then feed into a bespoke computer programme to map the true position of the tether against the backdrop of a cloudy sky.\n\nWith a bit of tweaking and data processing (the rarely seen \"boring bit\" of much modern research) Hilary is able to accurately model the position of her kite tether -- a tool that will prove vital in her ongoing research.\n\nThis film is part of a project funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering to develop the on camera communication skills of engineers across the UK.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZxzTBnaS76t18aop7ql4EsS","position":0,"publishedAt":"2012-11-01T10:15:59.000Z","title":"Scanning the Sky with Computer Code","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXL_oiHKNm0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXL_oiHKNm0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXL_oiHKNm0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXL_oiHKNm0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXL_oiHKNm0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"CXL_oiHKNm0"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"CXL_oiHKNm0","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-22T10:29:05.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/kpmMTZWMgYIX1eDu772AAlraAQU\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeHpUQm5hUzc2dDE4YW9wN3FsNEVzUy5GNjNDRDREMDQxOThCMDQ2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Most Ph.D.s focus on niche topics in a very specific field (see here) and Hilary Costello's research project is no different. Her ongoing Phd looks into the properties of aerodynamic stability of very long tethers for very high balloons or vew deep offshore oil and gas platforms underwater. \n\nUnderstanding tether dynamics is extremely complex with numerous factors effecting the behaviour of a cable - from the shape and aerodynamics of the tether to the elasticity, bending and torsion of the materials used not to mention the chaging wind speed and temperature at heights of up to 20km. \n\nTesting the cable dynamics of new tether designs in the real-world is a crucial part of the research process and by modelling and testing cables in isolated sections, it is possible to better understand and model how these may operate together in a larger system.\n\nWith limited access to mile-high balloons, Hilary can often be found in the green pastures of Cambridge University flying kites! Join her as she explains her quest to design an aerodynamic, stable tether that will reduce tension and, ultimately, lessen the risk of large-scale failure. \n\nThis film is part of a project funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering to develop the on camera  communication skills of engineers across the UK.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZxzTBnaS76t18aop7ql4EsS","position":1,"publishedAt":"2012-11-01T10:15:59.000Z","title":"20km High Kite Flying","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GIZr3R5JnEs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GIZr3R5JnEs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GIZr3R5JnEs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GIZr3R5JnEs\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/GIZr3R5JnEs\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"GIZr3R5JnEs"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"GIZr3R5JnEs","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-02T09:41:12.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/j5_FQaKwV-T_y0FOSCE_WKStn8g\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeHpUQm5hUzc2dDE4YW9wN3FsNEVzUy41NkI0NEY2RDEwNTU3Q0M2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Andrew Robertson is designing software that can monitor and follow the tempo of a live drummer.\n\nRather than the performer following exactly a pre-defined \"click track\" the system allows computer controlled samples and effects to be timed according to the drummers own pace.

However, Andrew Robertson, a Sound Engineer at Queen Mary University London, has been trying to unshackle a drummer from rigidly following a set beat by engineering software that can instead monitor and follow the drummer.\n\nWith his software a band can trigger computer controlled samples and effects that are timed accurately to a drummers tempo. Placing tempo control in the hands (or sticks) of a drummer in this way allows them to slow things down or speed things up, as and when they choose. \n\nIn theory, this produces more fluid and expressive performances -- and, ultimately, more interesting music. But how successful is this system at moderating tempo?

A Professor of Bioengineering at Nottingham University his work involves simulating accidents to analyse the forces and stress acting on the human skeleton.\n\nCycling home in late 2010 he was involved in the \"ultimate ironic accident\". Hit from behind by a car he suffered a broken neck, a lower back fracture and three cracked ribs, but was saved by his cycling helmet.\n\nAs Donal himself says, this outcome was determined not by chance, but by the laws of physics.\n\nIn this short film, he explores the cycle helmet technology used to prevent injuries and fatalities on the road -- including his own -- and demonstrates how the extra padding around your head dissipate the energy of the impact.\n\nIn the absence of volunteers for randomised controlled trials involving real accidents, Donal performs tests using computer simulations re-running the same accident and conditions with or without different types of helmet. Without a memory of his own near-fatal accident he can recreate the collision with a computer simulation to finally discover why he survived. \n\nThis film is part of a project funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering to develop the on camera  communication skills of engineers across the UK.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZxzTBnaS76t18aop7ql4EsS","position":5,"publishedAt":"2012-10-05T11:58:00.000Z","title":"Preventing cycling injury with physics","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SgH5ZwZ1OdI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SgH5ZwZ1OdI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SgH5ZwZ1OdI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"SgH5ZwZ1OdI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"SgH5ZwZ1OdI","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-05T14:27:46.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/WodwVe1J4ZG8OxgfhmLeGoGZQpM\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeHpUQm5hUzc2dDE4YW9wN3FsNEVzUy4wOTA3OTZBNzVEMTUzOTMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Serious accidents and deaths on the roads of Britain have been greatly reduced over the last 20 years -- not because we are safer drivers but because of better safety engineering.\n\nSeat belts, airbags and crumple zones have all contributed to this decline. However, as Donal McNally from the University of Nottingham explains, it is very difficult to protect the body from the huge increase in the forces impacting upon it in an accident.\n\nThe second most likely cause of death in a car accident is something called an \"aortic rupture\" and it remains a mystery.  Under increased pressure the aorta always ruptures in the same place but no one knows exactly why.  \n\nLike any good scientists or research engineer Donal is keen to test a particular hypothesis using real world simulations to discover the cause of aortic ruptures.\n\nCan he find the answer or will his hypothesis be disproved? \n\nThis film is part of a project funded by the Royal Academy of

In spring and summer 2012 we will make two films with the engineers, one produced in partnership with groups of young people.\n\nPlease note: Entry for this year's project has now closed. \n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZxzTBnaS76t18aop7ql4EsS","position":10,"publishedAt":"2013-01-11T11:05:42.000Z","title":"Royal Academy of Engineering - Audition call-out","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kO7kRvzC09E\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kO7kRvzC09E\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kO7kRvzC09E\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kO7kRvzC09E\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kO7kRvzC09E\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"kO7kRvzC09E"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"kO7kRvzC09E","videoPublishedAt":"2012-01-18T10:35:44.000Z"}}]}
