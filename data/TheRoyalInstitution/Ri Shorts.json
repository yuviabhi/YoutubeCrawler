Its journey to the fully fledged number we know and love today was a meandering one. Today, zero is both a placeholder, and tool, within our number system signifying an absence of a value, and as a number in its own right. \n\nBut it wasn\u2019t always seen as that, and it still doesn\u2019t act quite like other numbers. Can you divide by zero, for example? Hannah Fry explains how zero came about, from its origins in ancient civilisations, through the resistance it faced from the Roman numeral system, to being the cornerstone of calculus. \n\nWatch more of our lovingly crafted animations about science and maths here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PLbnrZHfNEDZwhNhy8qucR15N1_X1iZJzv\nAnd if you enjoyed this video, subscribe: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz9nlid50Jzz94lBn5E1-0-","position":0,"publishedAt":"2016-04-13T11:13:59.000Z","title":"What is Zero?

Could it be just an illusion manufactured in the theatre of our minds? And what use is it \u2013 why did it evolve in the first place? Professor Nicholas Humphrey explores the mystery.\n\nSubscribe for more science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nConsciousness is at the core of our very existence. An intangible constant that underpins our experience of the world. But for centuries it has been the frustrating source of a seemingly impenetrable explanatory gap \u2013 it is largely a scientific mystery.\n\nAs we interact with the world, stimuli trigger physical processes in our body. Nerve cells transmit messages around the body and through the brain. But how do these physical interactions give rise to the conscious sensations we experience? Can we get conscious sensation from nerve cells alone? \n\nIn this video theoretical psychologist Professor Nicholas Humphrey asks whether consciousness could all be an illusion. Could it be a mirage constructed in the theatre of our minds? Perhaps the questions we should ask are not centred on sensations themselves, but merely on the appearance of those sensations. \n\nAnd why does consciousness, in any form, exist at all? How did it evolve? The answer might lie in our social interactions. Consciousness elevates our interpretation of the world and the people around us. It alters our psychological profile and breathes joy into our experiences, and makes us value life itself. \n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz9nlid50Jzz94lBn5E1-0-","position":2,"publishedAt":"2014-09-11T15:17:11.000Z","title":"The Magic of Consciousness","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NHXCi6yZ-eA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NHXCi6yZ-eA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NHXCi6yZ-eA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NHXCi6yZ-eA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NHXCi6yZ-eA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"NHXCi6yZ-eA"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"NHXCi6yZ-eA","videoPublishedAt":"2014-09-11T13:39:28.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/6EbDKNgP3eZ3tl7RTJXUQS2RyTs\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejlubGlkNTBKeno5NGxCbjVFMS0wLS5DQ0MyQ0Y4Mzg0M0VGOEYw","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"A two-minute animated adventure to Ancient Greece and back again - voiced by Numberphile's James Grime!  \n\nOften called the \"birthplace of civilisation\", Ancient Greece heralded numerous advances in philosophy, science, sport and also mathematics. Over six centuries from 600 BC a group of revolutionary thinkers -- from Thales, Pythagoras, Democritus and Aristotle to Euclid, Archimedes and Hypatia of Alexandria -- formalised the rules and language of modern mathematics. \n\nFor Greek thinkers, maths wasn't simply a means of calculating amounts but a way of testing reality and understanding the true nature of the world around them. Indeed, Pythagoras is believed to have coined both the words \"philosophy\" (\"love of wisdom\") and \"mathematics\" (\"that which is learned\"). In turn, Euclid came to be known as the \"father of geometry\". \n\nAt the heart of this new understanding, was the concept of \"the proof\", developed by Euclid in what is commonly regarded as the most important and successful mathematical textbook of all time -- the \"Stoicheion\" or \"Elements\". Built upon the axiomatic method, mathematical proofs were a way of testing assumptions by building up a mathematical argument using self-evident or assumed statements (or, \"axioms\"). \n\nIt is this methodology that formed the foundational language and logic of modern mathematics throughout the world.  Indeed, Euclid's Elements was widely used as the seminal maths textbook right up until the start of the twentieth century. \n\nMany thanks to James Grime for his expert help on the script and recording the voice-over.

The Braggs' discoveries of 1913 remain at the foundation of modern day techniques and, to date, 29 Nobel Prizes have been awarded to work related to x-ray crystallography.\n\nOur thanks to Stephen Curry, Patience Thompson, and filmmaker Thom Hoffman.\n\nThis film was supported by the Science and Technologies Facilities Council (STFC):\nhttp:\/\/www.stfc.ac.uk\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz9nlid50Jzz94lBn5E1-0-","position":9,"publishedAt":"2013-11-21T10:39:42.000Z","title":"The humble Braggs and X-ray crystallography: Solving the patterns of matter","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z-ZnLtFgGwY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z-ZnLtFgGwY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z-ZnLtFgGwY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z-ZnLtFgGwY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/z-ZnLtFgGwY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"z-ZnLtFgGwY"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"z-ZnLtFgGwY","videoPublishedAt":"2013-11-21T10:31:10.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/9cPGNtXKQYr9LKcFfcTZlKAuZnk\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejlubGlkNTBKeno5NGxCbjVFMS0wLS45NzUwQkI1M0UxNThBMkU0","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Antimatter is one the biggest mysteries in fundamental physics, yet this elusive substance is essential to understanding the origins of our Universe. \n\nParticle physicist Tara Shears looks at the puzzling imbalance between matter and antimatter, exploring how early interactions between the two may have led to the matter dominated Universe we live in today.\n\nTo find out more about the anti-world, watch Tara Shears' full Friday Evening Discourse at the Ri: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=0Fy6oiIRwJc\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz9nlid50Jzz94lBn5E1-0-","position":10,"publishedAt":"2013-10-18T11:26:39.000Z","title":"A Matter of Antimatter - with Tara Shears","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R4AP29ejnOo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R4AP29ejnOo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R4AP29ejnOo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R4AP29ejnOo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/R4AP29ejnOo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"R4AP29ejnOo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"R4AP29ejnOo","videoPublishedAt":"2013-10-18T11:26:28.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/FlqEoErwWk0INgbKYd7EDKaGYh4\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejlubGlkNTBKeno5NGxCbjVFMS0wLS4yMDhBMkNBNjRDMjQxQTg1","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"The sun has been at the centre of human civilisation for millennia and our daily life cycles are pinned to its very presence.

Made up of doctors and scientists from University College London, University of Southampton and Duke University, the project also involved a group of healthy volunteers willing to be subjected to a series of intensive physical tests. \n\nThe team were braving the extreme conditions to investigate the underlying physiological reasons why some people can cope better with low oxygen conditions than others. Since the first expedition in 2007, the project is focusing not only on the amount of oxygen you can get into your system, but on how well you can deliver that oxygen to where it's needed and how efficiently your body then uses that oxygen.\n\nLying at 5,364 metres, Everest base camp contains around half the amount of oxygen compared to sea level, providing the perfect conditions for testing and research. In this case, the \"lab\" involves two insulated tents full of the latest medical technology, including two exercise bikes with full gas analysis systems, centrifuges and blood sampling kits -- all of which had to be brought from Lukla airport (a ten day trek). \n\nMany of the team work in Intensive Care Units and are interested in examining what happens to the body when there is not enough oxygen reaching their vital organs. Whether through lung failure, a heart attack or a stroke, 90% of intensive care patients suffer from the effects of a shortage of oxygen.

We joined Dr Peter Wothers on the roof of the Ri building in London to show exactly why.\n\nAbove the famous Lecture Theatre, the team set up a clear protective shield around a beaker filled with 150ml of oil. This was heated over a Bunsen until a small fire was burning. Wearing a fire protective suit, Dr Wothers then poured water from a small cup directly onto the fire.\n\nThe reaction is so violent because water and oil don't mix. When the water is poured into the beaker of burning oil it sinks to the bottom and, due to the intense heat, vaporizes into steam almost instantaneously. With this phase change from a liquid to a gaseous state the water expands by up to 1700 times and forces the fire above it upwards. This oxygenates the oil and creates the huge flame you can see in the video.       \n\nPeter Wothers explains more:\n\n\"This is a great reaction to illustrate the topic of our second Christmas Lecture (Water), but it would also have done for Fire too if we had been presenting a fourth lecture. It is one of my favourite demos since it really rams home how dangerous it is to add water to an oil fire.

The idea contradicted almost everything scientists thought at the time, and it took the detailed work of a brilliant cartographer to prove him right.\n\nConventional ideas held that the ocean floors were flat, featureless planes. As expeditions started to go around the world collecting ocean depth measurements, Marie Tharp \u2013 not allowed to join the expeditions herself \u2013 processed the data and began to craft detailed, revealing maps of the hidden ocean depths. \n\nShe discovered that the ocean floor was in fact a complex assortment of peaks and troughs. In particular, her profiles revealed stark rift valleys, which supported Wegener\u2019s controversial ideas. Even then, it took a long time to convince the scientific community that her findings were correct. Eventually, however, she was proved right, and Marie Tharp took her rightful place as one of history\u2019s finest cartographers. \n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz9nlid50Jzz94lBn5E1-0-","position":29,"publishedAt":"2016-11-16T09:16:36.000Z","title":"Marie Tharp: Uncovering the Secrets of the Ocean Floor - with Helen Czerski","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"TgfYjS0OTWw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"TgfYjS0OTWw","videoPublishedAt":"2016-11-16T09:16:35.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/GWoS-soOLCeaPAeXwtn6SANH8qQ\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejlubGlkNTBKeno5NGxCbjVFMS0wLS4zRDBDOEZDOUM0MDY5NEEz","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"There are over 18,000 artificial objects tracked orbiting our planet.

According to Faraday's notes of the lecture, a volcano was built out of clay and gravel and pieces of the highly reactive metal potassium were placed into the crater and the fissures at the sides. Davy then poured water into the fissures. Water reacts with potassium, producing potassium hydroxide and the highly flammable hydrogen gas. While we now know that this is not the mechanism behind volcanic eruptions as Davy suggested, the experiment is still a spectacular demonstration of a natural phenomenon, and at the time, cemented Davy's status are one of the most engaging lecturers or his era.\n\nTo find out more about Humphry Davy's life, his scientific accomplishments and his poetry, join the free online course by Lancaster University - Humphry Davy: Laughing Gas, Literature, and the Lamp https:\/\/www.futurelearn.com\/courses\/humphry-davy\/1 \n\nVideo copyright: Lancaster University\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz9nlid50Jzz94lBn5E1-0-","position":32,"publishedAt":"2017-10-10T09:44:42.000Z","title":"Humphry Davy's Potassium Volcano","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nxRHQ1xfnWc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nxRHQ1xfnWc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nxRHQ1xfnWc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nxRHQ1xfnWc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nxRHQ1xfnWc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"nxRHQ1xfnWc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"nxRHQ1xfnWc","videoPublishedAt":"2017-08-09T11:01:09.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/r2708_EdsfDN9B6lGQwt8oq9ajE\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejlubGlkNTBKeno5NGxCbjVFMS0wLS45RjNFMDhGQ0Q2RkFCQTc1","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Have you ever tried walking in a straight line with your eyes closed?

Why does it make us laugh? It\u2019s hard to pin down a scientific definition \u2013 or explanation \u2013 of tickling. It\u2019s a complex phenomenon, involving a range of sensory and neurological elements, which means it\u2019s hard to identify why it evolved. Is it socially significant? Or an alarm system, warning us of things crawling on our skin?\n\nWhy can\u2019t you tickle yourself? Dr Emily Grossman explains how your brain anticipates the movement of your hands, and suppresses the tickle response.

But how are those particles controlled? With the help of two visual demonstrations, Suzie Sheehy explains.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nWatch Suzie's lecture on her research and the future of particle accelerators: https:\/\/youtu.be\/jLmciZdh5j4\nAnd watch our film on how to power a particle accelerator: https:\/\/youtu.be\/-F9EqYLQKYI\n\nKeeping a handle on particles is key to the huge range of applications particle accelerators have. The machines accelerate beams of particles using electric and magnetic fields. Suzie uses a \u2018Paul trap\u2019 to show how rapidly oscillating currents are used to keep particles on track. A ball on the saddle apparatus is kept in the centre by the rising sides. But that only controls the ball in one direction, meaning it can drop off. Magnetic or electric fields are similar, and can only direct particles in one plane at a time. When the kit begins to spin, though, the alternating position of the rising sides means the ball is contained in the center. This has the same effect that quadrupole magnets in an accelerator have, constantly alternating gradients to keep particles in line.\n\nUsing a more sophisticated setup, a quadrupole linear Paul trap, pollen grains can be held in place in a beam just as particles in an accelerator would be. Oscillating fields established across rods on opposite corners of the system keep the pollen particles trapped. Without the rapidly changing fields, the particles would just shoot off in one direction; it\u2019s the changes that keep them from escaping in one or the other direction.\n\nThese simple analogies show how particle accelerators guide particles into focused beams, to be harnessed for a huge range of applications.\n\nThis video is supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz9nlid50Jzz94lBn5E1-0-","position":37,"publishedAt":"2017-10-13T13:45:39.000Z","title":"How To Trap Particles in a Particle Accelerator","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"LR_aNOcnH0Q"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"LR_aNOcnH0Q","videoPublishedAt":"2016-08-25T08:13:44.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ggWtCUIr-U5CGoV8aMebCItaWTU\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejlubGlkNTBKeno5NGxCbjVFMS0wLS4zQzFBN0RGNzNFREFCMjBE","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Watch the English language version here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=uqQlwYv8VQI\n\nLa cristallographie aux rayons X est sans doute l'une des plus grandes d\u00e9couvertes du vingti\u00e8me si\u00e8cle.

Can we ever do more with less energy?\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz9nlid50Jzz94lBn5E1-0-","position":42,"publishedAt":"2017-11-02T10:18:07.000Z","title":"Controlling Your Body With Electricity - 2016 CHRISTMAS LECTURES","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Gm9ZDzltp5M\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Gm9ZDzltp5M\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Gm9ZDzltp5M\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Gm9ZDzltp5M\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Gm9ZDzltp5M\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"Gm9ZDzltp5M"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"Gm9ZDzltp5M","videoPublishedAt":"2017-03-15T14:54:59.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/B-aX522o4doghCFYpl5eS5q17oU\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejlubGlkNTBKeno5NGxCbjVFMS0wLS4yQjZFRkExQjFGODk3RUFD","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Professor Ian Chapman joins Saiful Islam to explain how fusion reactors create plasma, and control it with magnetic fields.\n\nWatch Ian Chapman's lecture on cutting edge fusion technology here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=zn1SJOPgewo\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe first Lecture from Professor Saiful Islam's 2016 series of CHRISTMAS LECTURES, 'Supercharged: Fuelling the future'.\n\n2016 marked the 80th anniversary since the BBC first broadcast the Christmas Lectures on TV. To celebrate, chemist Professor Saiful Islam explores a subject that the lectures\u2019 founder \u2013 Michael Faraday \u2013 addressed in the very first Christmas Lectures \u2013 energy. In his first lecture, Saiful investigates one of the most important challenges facing humankind \u2013 how to generate energy without destroying the planet in the process. As part of the celebrations, Saiful invites former Christmas Lecturers to join him on stage, and repeats some of the most exciting (and dangerous) experiments and demonstrations from the past.\n\nSaiful begins his lecture by being plunged into darkness. Armed initially with nothing but a single candle, his challenge is to go back to first principles and bring back the power in the energy-hungry lecture theatre. Along the way he explains what energy is, how we can transform it from one form to another, and how we harness it to power the modern world.\n\nA fascinating and stimulating celebration of the stuff that quite literally makes the universe tick \u2013- the weird and wonderful world of energy.\n\nThanks to our major supporter, Lloyd's Register Foundation, and whole community of supporters: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/about\/news\/autumn-2016\/our-2016-christmas-lectures-supporters\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz9nlid50Jzz94lBn5E1-0-","position":43,"publishedAt":"2017-11-02T10:18:48.000Z","title":"How Fusion Reactors Control Plasma - 2016 CHRISTMAS LECTURES","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kxmXl8wtoeU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kxmXl8wtoeU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kxmXl8wtoeU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kxmXl8wtoeU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kxmXl8wtoeU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"kxmXl8wtoeU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"kxmXl8wtoeU","videoPublishedAt":"2017-03-02T16:22:56.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Vko66_WMd5CVkcj3sHMSVddL18Y\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejlubGlkNTBKeno5NGxCbjVFMS0wLS4yQUJFNUVCMzVDNjcxRTlF","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Saiful Islam drops a nail through a lithium battery, and explains what it is that causes mobile phones to explode in the third of the 2016 CHRISTMAS LECTURES.\n\nSaiful Islam presents his final Lecture from his 2016 series, 'Supercharged: Fuelling the future'.\nIn this year\u2019s final Royal Institution CHRISTMAS LECTURES, chemist Saiful Islam explores of one of the most important issues facing the modern world \u2013 how to store energy. Over the course of the lecture, he tackles his toughest challenge yet: trying to work out how to store enough energy to power a mobile phone for a whole year and still fit it in his pocket! With the UK generating nearly twenty times as much energy today as it did 80 years ago, finding better ways to store it is vital for all of our futures.\n\nThis year celebrates the 80th anniversary of the BBC first broadcasting them on TV. To help mark this occasion, Saiful is joined by former Christmas Lecturers on stage, and repeats and re-imagines some of the most famous experiments and demonstrations.\n\nLive experiments include an attempt to break the world-record for the most powerful battery made of lemons and a clear-eyed look at the most energy-packed fuel in the world \u2013 hydrogen.
