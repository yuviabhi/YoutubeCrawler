An innovative research project uses speech analysis to spot hints of underlying anxieties.\nDay 19 of our advent calendar, A Place Called Space http:\/\/rigb.org\/advent\n\nBeing an astronaut is a stressful job. You face the constant threat of annihilation, and know that a huge team and expensive mission rely on you doing your job well. \n\nBut astronauts aren\u2019t always the best at identifying, or admitting, when they\u2019re stressed or overwhelmed. Sarita Robinson, a psychologist from the University of Central Lancaster, says that while we\u2019re increasingly comfortable with the intense physiological conditions of space travel, our understanding of the psychological impacts still leaves something to be desired. Mark Huckvale and a team at University College London ran a research project that investigated whether subtle variations in speech patterns of astronauts taking part in the Mars 500 experiment might reveal anxieties that the astronauts\u2019 words were hiding.\n\nCould subtle cues in the way an astronaut speaks let mission control know when they\u2019re starting to feel the strain?\n\n\u2018A Place Called Space\u2019 is the 2015 Royal Institution advent calendar.
