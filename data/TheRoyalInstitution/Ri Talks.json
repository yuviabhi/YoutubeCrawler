Cognitive neuroscientist Jon Simons considers the latest evidence.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nWatch the Q&A here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/QPuOr6_4GhA\n\nThe ability to remember personally experienced events in vivid, multisensory detail makes an immensely important contribution to our lives, allowing us to re-live each moment of a previous encounter and providing us with the store of precious memories that form the building blocks of who we are. Such remembering involves reactivating sensory and perceptual features of an event, and the thoughts and feelings we had when the event occurred, integrating them into a conscious first-person experience. It allows us to make judgments about the things we remember, such as distinguishing events that actually occurred from those we might have imagined or been told about. Although a great deal is known about the cognitive and neural processes that enable us to recall a word list, for example, considerably less is known about the processes underlying the subjective experience of remembering.\n\nJon Simons is a reader in Cognitive Neuroscience at Cambridge University.

But how do quantum computers work? \nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nJoin leading experts to untangle the quantum computing hype, at this event supported by the Embassy of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.\n\nArtur Ekert works on information processing in quantum-mechanical systems. His invention of entanglement-based quantum cryptography in 1991 triggered an explosion of research efforts worldwide and continues to inspire new research directions. As well as showing that Bell\u2019s inequalities can be used to test for eavesdropping, he has contributed to many important advances in the foundations and experimental realisations of quantum communication and computation. He has played a leading role in transforming quantum information science into a vibrant interdisciplinary field.\n\nHarry Buhrman got his PhD in Computer Science from the University of Amsterdam.  Buhrman built the quantum computing group at CWI, which was one of the first groups worldwide and the first in The Netherlands working on quantum information processing. Buhrman\u2019s research focuses on quantum computing, algorithms, and complexity theory. He co-developed the area of quantum communication complexity (quantum distributed computing), and demonstrated for the first time that certain communication tasks can be solved (exponentially) more efficient with quantum resources. This showed that quantum computers can not only speed up computations, but also communication \u2013 which opened up a whole new application area of quantum information processing. Buhrman co-developed a general method to establish the limitations of quantum computers, and a framework for the study of quantum algorithms, which is now textbook material.\n\nIn 2001, Harry Buhrman became professor of algorithms, complexity theory, and quantum computing at the University of Amsterdam (UvA) and group leader of the Quantum Computing Group at the Center for Mathematics and Informatics (CWI). Buhrman co-founded QuSoft in 2015, a research center for quantum software, for which he is also co-director. During his career, Buhrman obtained various prestigious awards. Buhrman also has a leading role in the national Quantum Software Consortium that was awarded an NWO Gravity grant in 2017.\u201d\n\nThe event is chaired by award-winning science writer Philip Ball, whose latest book is entitled 'Beyond Weird: Why Everything You Thought You Knew About Quantum Physics Is Different.'\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":23,"publishedAt":"2018-05-02T14:06:28.000Z","title":"Quantum Computing: Untangling the Hype","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wE1OCXvaDtc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wE1OCXvaDtc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wE1OCXvaDtc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wE1OCXvaDtc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wE1OCXvaDtc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"wE1OCXvaDtc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"wE1OCXvaDtc","videoPublishedAt":"2018-05-02T14:06:27.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ExtnQc7ZV7tgB2gyXYByztiqybk\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy4wMjVEMzc2NzY2ODVBOERB","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Are your genes to blame when your jeans don't fit?

And underpinning every measurement is the International System of Units \u2013 \u2018The SI\u2019. In 2019 the world will change its definition of four key SI units, including the unit of mass (the kilogram) and temperature (the kelvin and the degree Celsius).\n\nInstead of defining these units in terms of arbitrary standards, we will switch to making measurements based on the natural constants of the world around us.\n\nMichael de Podesta's is a scientist at the UK\u2019s National Physical Laboratory (NPL).

She builds mathematical and computational models to explain how diseases spread through populations, with the aim of designing interventions that can prevent that spread. She has worked on models to understand the transmission of Ebola, influenza, other respiratory viruses and Zika.\n\nVinay Gupta is a technologist and policy analyst with a particular interest in how specific technologies can close or create new avenues for decision makers. This interest has taken him through cryptography, energy policy, defence, security, resilience and disaster management arenas. He is the founder of Hexayurt.Capital, a fund which invests in creating the Internet of Agreements\u2122. He is known for his work on the hexayurt, a public domain disaster relief shelter designed to be build from commonly-available materials, and with Ethereum, a distributed network designed to handle smart contracts.\n\nHugh Lewis is a Senior Lecturer in Aerospace Engineering at the University of Southampton, author of the space debris evolutionary model DAMAGE and he lead the Astronautics Research Group\u2019s space debris and space situational awareness activities. He is also a member of the UK's delegation to the UN Space Mission Planning Advisory Group, a roundtable of experts who discuss how to prepare an international response to near Earth objects (ie asteroids).\n\nThis talk was filmed at the Royal Institution on 28 June 2017.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":45,"publishedAt":"2018-01-10T15:04:50.000Z","title":"The Apocalypse and How to Avoid It","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FPxBhqonZEQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FPxBhqonZEQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FPxBhqonZEQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FPxBhqonZEQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FPxBhqonZEQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"FPxBhqonZEQ"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"FPxBhqonZEQ","videoPublishedAt":"2018-01-10T15:04:38.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Hydc1WUVXMN76un3LKBCA0atHBk\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy45REM1NzQ1MDM2OUZDNDMx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Every species seems beautifully adapted to its way of life, so why do species ever change?

Hiranya Peiris answers questions from the audience following her talk.\nWatch the full talk here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/5HXOfIwl9Jo\n\nModern fundamental physics contains ideas just as revolutionary as those of Copernicus or Newton; ideas that may radically change our understanding of the world; ideas such as extra dimensions of space, or the possible existence of other universes.\n\nTesting these concepts requires enormous energies, far higher than what is achievable by the Large Hadron Collider at CERN, and in fact, beyond any conceivable Earth-bound experiments. However, at the Big Bang, the Universe itself performed the ultimate experiment and left clues and evidence about what was behind the origin of the cosmos as we know it, and how it is evolving. And the biggest clue is the afterglow of the Big Bang itself.\n\nIn the past decade we have been able to answer age-old questions accurately, such as how old the Universe is, what it contains, and its destiny. Along with these answers have also come many exciting new questions. Join Hiranya Peiris to unravel the detective story, explaining what we have uncovered, and how we know what we know.\n\nHiranya Peiris is Professor of Astrophysics in the Astrophysics Group in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University College London. She is also the Principal Investigator of the CosmicDawn project, funded by the European Research Council\n\nShe is also a member of the Planck Collaboration and of the ongoing Dark Energy Survey, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope. Her work both delves into the Cosmic Microwave Background and contributes towards the next generation galaxy surveys that will yield deep insights into the evolution of the Universe.\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":62,"publishedAt":"2017-11-02T10:37:25.000Z","title":"Q&A - Cosmology: Galileo to Gravitational Waves","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/63JbKXfedRE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/63JbKXfedRE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/63JbKXfedRE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/63JbKXfedRE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/63JbKXfedRE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"63JbKXfedRE"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"63JbKXfedRE","videoPublishedAt":"2016-08-10T08:00:01.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/PzJlEVxSHhZpSuCU6pwrLyrwYzs\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy41NEI5MkYxNzc0MDczQUUw","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Everything around us is made of \u2018stuff\u2019, or matter.

However, at the Big Bang, the Universe itself performed the ultimate experiment and left clues and evidence about what was behind the origin of the cosmos as we know it, and how it is evolving. And the biggest clue is the afterglow of the Big Bang itself.\n\nIn the past decade we have been able to answer age-old questions accurately, such as how old the Universe is, what it contains, and its destiny. Along with these answers have also come many exciting new questions. Join Hiranya Peiris to unravel the detective story, explaining what we have uncovered, and how we know what we know.\n\nHiranya Peiris is Professor of Astrophysics in the Astrophysics Group in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at University College London. She is also the Principal Investigator of the CosmicDawn project, funded by the European Research Council\n\nShe is also a member of the Planck Collaboration and of the ongoing Dark Energy Survey, the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope.

Yet in the final decades of his life he was also ignored by most working scientists, his ideas opposed by even his closest friends. Bestselling author of E=mc\u00b2, David Bodanis, discusses Einstein's Greatest Mistake, a brisk, accessible biography of Albert Einstein that reveals the genius and hubris of the titan of modern science.\nDavid Bodanis was born in Chicago, lived in France for a decade, and makes his home in London. He studied mathematics, physics and history at the University of Chicago, and for many years taught the \"Intellectual Tool-Kit\" course at Oxford University.

To do this current methods require proteins to be dissolved in a solution or locked in a crystal lattice. These approaches are incredibly powerful and are the mainstay of the field of structural biology as we know it. But what about the third phase? How would proteins survive once they have gone beyond solid and solution phases and released into the atmosphere?\n\nWhile many scientists thought that proteins would no longer maintain their shape in the vapour phase Carol Robinson embarked on eccentric research into studying proteins freely moving within in this phase. This work proved to be unpredictably worthwhile, and her gas phase structural biology is now providing a new view of dynamic interactions between proteins, lipids and drugs.\n\nDame Carol Robinson is a British chemist, working as a Royal Society Research Professor at the Physical and Theoretical Chemistry Laboratory at the University of Oxford.\n\nCarol is the first female Professor of Chemistry at the University of Oxford and was previously the first female Professor of Chemistry at the University of Cambridge. She is renowned for pioneering the use of mass spectrometry as an analytical tool and for her ground-breaking research  into the 3D structure of proteins.\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":137,"publishedAt":"2016-07-06T08:39:35.000Z","title":"A New Phase for Structural Biology - with Carol Robinson","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IZ0EvEmLk_M\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IZ0EvEmLk_M\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IZ0EvEmLk_M\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IZ0EvEmLk_M\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/IZ0EvEmLk_M\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"IZ0EvEmLk_M"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"IZ0EvEmLk_M","videoPublishedAt":"2016-07-06T08:00:01.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/m4CiuHKQ1eVZPqVz9RkeC4Sifrg\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy5ENjg3MEUyQ0IzODMzQThB","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"You can also listen to this event on our podcast.

Why do we need sleep and what are the physiological processes driving our circadian rhythm? When is our circadian clock disrupted and how does this affect our health? Cognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs the debate.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe science behind sleeplessness can help us understand our rhythms so we can live better and healthier lives. While hormones, such a melatonin, play a role in driving our circadian clock, the amount of sleep we get and our sleep cycles also affect our hormonal release patterns, with far-reaching implications on our health.\nCognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs a discussion with a panel of experts who specialise in circadian rhythms. They explore how light detection plays a role in our sleep-wake cycles, how hormone release is regulated and the implications of changes to our circadian clock and sleeplessness over time.\n\nThis event was supported by British Psychological Society and Society for Endocrinology.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":138,"publishedAt":"2016-06-29T10:21:22.000Z","title":"The Science of Sleep: Melatonin to Neural Pathways","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0Uzy35uJzU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0Uzy35uJzU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0Uzy35uJzU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0Uzy35uJzU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0Uzy35uJzU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"O0Uzy35uJzU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"O0Uzy35uJzU","videoPublishedAt":"2016-06-29T08:00:00.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/JOSdgrUZ0rNGIRlf-AXz_14x4fA\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy5EODkyNDMzRkJBNkQ2NkMz","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"In a lightning tour of human reasoning, world-renowned psychologist Richard Nisbett shines a new light on the shadowy world of the way we think \u2013 and how we can make our lives, and the lives of those around us, better.\nWatch the Q&A here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=V2Ci4ro75fM\n\nRichard Nisbett is Theodore M.

Sally explores mind controlling sperm, penguin prostitution, and how jealousy can affect sperm production.\n\nThis talk was filmed at Ri Lates at the Royal Institution on 24 October 2014.\n\nFor more from Sally, subscribe to her channel: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/shedscience \n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":207,"publishedAt":"2015-01-28T14:26:20.000Z","title":"The Science of Sex - with Sally Le Page","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/W3ZM7Sjvdgc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/W3ZM7Sjvdgc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/W3ZM7Sjvdgc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/W3ZM7Sjvdgc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/W3ZM7Sjvdgc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"W3ZM7Sjvdgc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"W3ZM7Sjvdgc","videoPublishedAt":"2015-01-28T14:26:19.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/2fxt6nWmeO2FIh2UB9GE_j0BRlM\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy5GNjAwN0Y0QTFGOTVDMEMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"What\u2019s the greatest human mutation of all time?

Andrew Pontzen introduces the stranger side of the cosmos \u2013 dark matter and dark energy \u2013 but then argues that these things are not so weird or unexpected after all. The strangest thing is that our rule-laden cosmos should be so predictable.\n\nAndrew Pontzen is a lecturer and Royal Society University Research Fellow at University College London, as well as a musician and science communicator. His work focuses on galaxy formation and computational cosmology, as well as some early-Universe physics. Previously, he has held fellowships at Oxford Astrophysics and at the Kavli Institute for Cosmology in Cambridge.

There, the gravitational pull will be so much stronger on your feet than your head, that you will be 'spaghettified'. Now, a new theory proposes that instead of spaghettification, you will encounter a massive wall of fire that will incinerate you on the spot, before you get close to turning into vermicelli.\n\nIn this special Ri event, science writer Jennifer Ouellette and physicist Sean Carroll explore the black hole firewall paradox, the exotic physics that underlies the new theory and what the paradox tells us about how new scientific theories are proposed, tested and accepted.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":217,"publishedAt":"2014-06-20T10:56:41.000Z","title":"Black hole Firewalls with Sean Carroll and Jennifer Ouellette","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_8bhtEgB8Mo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_8bhtEgB8Mo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_8bhtEgB8Mo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_8bhtEgB8Mo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_8bhtEgB8Mo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"_8bhtEgB8Mo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"_8bhtEgB8Mo","videoPublishedAt":"2014-06-20T10:53:54.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/wYbCXCDhUba1I5mwX1TMoghjq74\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy41MzY4MzcwOUFFRUU3QzEx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Subscribe for the latest science videos:\n http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nIf you ask people what makes them laugh, they will tell you they laugh at jokes: however if you look at when they laugh a very different pattern emerges, in which laughter can be seen as an extremely important social emotion. \n\nIn this Ri event, Sophie Scott explores the science of laughter, from laughter in other animals to the acoustics of laughter, and the ways that laughter is processed in our brains.\n\nThe science of laughter was presented at the Ri on Friday 28 March 2014.\n\nThis event is part of our all-women line up for Friday Evening Discourses in 2014 as part of our year long celebration of women in science. \n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":218,"publishedAt":"2014-06-11T08:13:58.000Z","title":"The Science of Laughter with Sophie Scott","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4BWRoHGiwrw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4BWRoHGiwrw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4BWRoHGiwrw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4BWRoHGiwrw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4BWRoHGiwrw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"4BWRoHGiwrw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"4BWRoHGiwrw","videoPublishedAt":"2014-06-11T08:10:21.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/SRrVir35iRySyy6zT4cQ2WdaRl4\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy5DNkMwRUI2MkI4QkI4NDFG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Subscribe for more science videos :http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nHelp us transcribe this lecture:  http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/timedtext_video?v=0g8lANs6zpQ\nIf you were able to make a substance change colour, or turn from a solid to a liquid, would that be magic?

The challenge is to identify whether the second picture is the same view as the first, or whether it's moved closer or further away.

Try it now http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gdzmNwTLakg&t=35m20s\n\n\nOur memories are our lives, and a fundamental basis of our culture. Collective memoirs of the past both bind society together and shape our potential future. With our brains we can travel through time and space, calling to mind places of significance, evoking images and emotions of past experiences. It's no wonder, then, that we so desperately fear the prospect of memory loss.\n\nMany regions of the brain are involved in memory, but one of the most critical components is the hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in the formation of long-term memories. Damage to the hippocampus can therefore result in significant memory loss.\n\nIn this Friday Evening Discourse, Eleanor Maguire draws on evidence from virtual reality, brain imaging and studies of amnesia to show that the consequences of hippocampal damage are even more far-reaching than suspected, robbing us of our past, our imagination and altering our perception of the world.\n\nMaguire also explains how, despite our beliefs, our memories are not actually as accurate as you might think. In fact, they're not really even about the past.\n\nThis event is part of our all-women line up for Friday Evening Discourses in 2014 as part of our year long celebration of women in science.

But how much do we really know about taste?\n\nBarry Smith, Founding Director of the Centre for the Study of the Senses is joined by a historian, a neuroscientist, an artist and a chef in order to explore the many dimensions of food and taste. Together they reveal how our experience of flavours is shaped not only by taste and smell, but also by our environment, the context of the meal we are eating, and even visual cues such as the shape and colour of our plate. Through this we discover how tastes are developed and acquired and why we like some foods more than others.\n\nThe event begins with four short talks by Chris Woolgar, Charles Spence, Caroline Hobkinson and Charles Michel, after which the audience sampled a four course experimental tasting menu for the senses.\n\nThe event was held in partnership with the AHRC Science in Culture Theme which encourages mutual exchange between researchers working across the sciences, arts and humanities.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":229,"publishedAt":"2013-11-07T14:10:24.000Z","title":"Food, the Brain and Us: Exploring our historical, cultural and sensory perceptions of food","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ygdbRCdsM6g\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ygdbRCdsM6g\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ygdbRCdsM6g\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"ygdbRCdsM6g"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"ygdbRCdsM6g","videoPublishedAt":"2013-11-07T14:10:14.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/TbqVZnpC3VpN5U_iwQSW2PafbHs\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy44Mjc5REFBRUE2MTdFRDU0","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"X-Ray Crystallography might seem like an obscure, even unheard of field of research; however structural analysis has played a part in almost every major scientific field since its discovery 100 years ago by William Henry, and William Lawrence Bragg.\n\nIn this Friday Evening Discourse at the Royal Institution, Professor Stephen Curry charts the discovery and development of this extraordinary technique, starting with a simple explanation of diffraction, moving through the integral work of the Braggs, and ending with the cutting edge uses that X-Ray Crystallography has found in the modern world.\n\nThis film is part of the Crystallography Collection: a series of short films produced by the Ri Channel, with the support of the Science and Technology Facilities Council (STFC), celebrating the 100th anniversary of the discovery of X-Ray Crystallography by the Braggs\n\nRead Stephen Curry's blog post about this event: http:\/\/rigb.org\/blog\/2013\/november\/stephen-curry-fed\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":230,"publishedAt":"2013-11-05T12:20:42.000Z","title":"Seeing Things in a Different Light: How X-ray crystallography revealed the structure of everything","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gBxZVF3s4cU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gBxZVF3s4cU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gBxZVF3s4cU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gBxZVF3s4cU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/gBxZVF3s4cU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"gBxZVF3s4cU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"gBxZVF3s4cU","videoPublishedAt":"2013-11-05T12:20:33.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ETlEB_dHxS2ID1YNzQm2s2asx20\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy4yQUE2Q0JEMTk4NTM3RTZC","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Antimatter, an identical, oppositely charged version of normal matter, is one of the most mysterious substances in the Universe and very little of it survives today.

Biology is, at its most basic, chemistry, and chemistry is built on the rules of quantum mechanics in the way atoms and molecules behave and fit together. \n\nAs Jim explains, biologists have until recently been dismissive of counter-intuitive aspects of the theory and feel it to be unnecessary, preferring their traditional ball-and-stick models of the molecular structures of life. Likewise, physicists have been reluctant to venture into the messy and complex world of the living cell - why should they when they can test their theories far more cleanly in the controlled environment of the physics lab?\n\nBut now, experimental techniques in biology have become so sophisticated that the time is ripe for testing ideas familiar to quantum physicists. Can quantum phenomena in the subatomic world impact the biological level and be present in living cells or processes - from the way proteins fold or genes mutate and the way plants harness light in photosynthesis to the way some birds navigate using the Earth's magnetic field? All appear to utilise what Jim terms \"the weirdness of the quantum world\".\n\nThe discourse explores multiple theories of quantum mechanics, from superposition to quantum tunnelling, and reveals why \"the most powerful theory in the whole of science\" remains incredibly mysterious. Plus, watch out for a fantastic explanation of the famous double slit experiment. \n\nWatch this video on the Ri Channel with additional learning materials:\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/X826sE\n\nFriday Evening Discourses\n\nThe tradition of Friday evening discourses at the Royal Institution was started by Michael Faraday in 1825. Since that time most major scientific figures have spoken in the famous Lecture Theatre at the heart of the Ri building at 21 Albemarle Street. Notable talks include Faraday announcing the existence of the technology of photography in 1839 and J.J. Thomson announcing the existence of the fundamental particle later called the electron in 1897.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":236,"publishedAt":"2013-03-20T11:57:24.000Z","title":"Jim Al-Khalili - Quantum Life: How Physics Can Revolutionise Biology","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"wwgQVZju1ZM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"wwgQVZju1ZM","videoPublishedAt":"2013-01-30T14:48:07.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/sno1ePqgXtNn7O4KkEwBnK6yCvg\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy41MjE1MkI0OTQ2QzJGNzNG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"It was the universe's most elusive particle, the linchpin for everything scientists dreamed up to explain how stuff works.

But what is a drug? And who is it that should decide what a drug is?\n\nIn this Ri event chaired by Kate Kelland, EMEA Health and Science Correspondent for Reuters, Sharon Ruston and David Nutt explore the past, present and future of our societal and political attitudes towards drugs. From supposedly \"medical\" experimentations in the 18th and 19th centuries, to modern-day government drugs policy and the rise of new 'legal highs'.\n\nIn the 1800s, eminent Ri scientist Humphry Davy carried out numerous experiments on the effects of breathing nitrous oxide, testing it on both himself and others. These experiences lead to his claim that this drug could \"destroy our pains and increase our pleasures\". Comparing Davy's trials with those of Thomas De Quincey with opium, Sharon Ruston, Professor of Romanticism at Lancaster University, explores what were clearly some rather blurred boundaries between medical and recreational drug use at this time. Both nitrous oxide and opium have become invaluable medicines, the first as an anaesthetic, the second as morphine -- one of our most powerful forms of pain relief. But it seems during these early experimentations that these drugs' were heralded as much for their pleasurable uses as for the control of pain, enabling humans to access a new world of \"sublime perception\".\n\nSuch research was aided by the fact that, in Davy's day, science had little, if any, interference from politics. Times have certainly changed, and the use and classification of drugs has become heavily entrenched in politics. In the second half of the talk psychiatrist and neuropsychopharmacologist Prof David Nutt, explores this complex relationship, considering the challenges posed by politics, media and the alcohol industry in the future of drugs policy. Nutt raises some controversial questions, including whether alcohol is more dangerous than other drugs, and gives his thoughts on what drugs, and society's view of them, will look like in the future.\n\nYou can watch the Q&A from the event here: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Lyc5Eyw8SoA\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZz256ho3Q4gt7YrF2xApo5g","position":258,"publishedAt":"2014-03-20T14:36:58.000Z","title":"Drugs, science and society; past, present and future","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qUNzoa991g4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qUNzoa991g4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qUNzoa991g4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qUNzoa991g4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qUNzoa991g4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"qUNzoa991g4"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"qUNzoa991g4","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-20T14:36:53.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/YoaN00D4m9nLw3VzkvsH1OmFv6g\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaejI1NmhvM1E0Z3Q3WXJGMnhBcG81Zy5BRjJDODk5REM0NjkzMUIy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Psychiatrist and neuropsychopharmacologist Prof David Nutt, and Sharon Ruston, Professor of Romanticism at Lancaster University, explore the past, present and future of our societal and political attitudes towards drugs.
