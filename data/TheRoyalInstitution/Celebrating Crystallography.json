Such patterns are often beautiful to behold and designs based on these arrangements have now been used in many buildings throughout the world.\n\nIn this Ri event Sir Roger Penrose reveals the mathematical underpinnings and origins of these \"forbidden symmetries\" and other related patterns. His talk is illustrated with numerous examples of their use in architectural design including a novel version of \"Penrose tiling\" that appears in the approach to the main entrance of the new Mathematics Institute in Oxford, officially opened in late 2013 (http:\/\/www.maths.ox.ac.uk\/new-building). \n\nThe tiling is constructed from several thousand diamond-shaped granite tiles of just two different shapes, decorated simply with circular arcs of stainless steel. The matching of the tiles forces them into an overall pattern which never repeats itself and exhibits remarkable aspects of 5-fold and 10-fold symmetry.\n\nSimilar features have been found also in the atomic structures of quasi-crystalline materials. The initial discovery of such material earned Dan Shectman the 2011 Nobel Prize for chemistry, his work having launched a completely novel area of crystallography. \n\nImages of the completed Mathematics Institute in Oxford courtesy of Vanesa Penrose.\n\nThe filming and production of this event was supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council: http:\/\/www.stfc.ac.uk.

Such patterns are often beautiful to behold and designs based on these arrangements have now been used in many buildings throughout the world.\n\nIn this Ri event Sir Roger Penrose reveals the mathematical underpinnings and origins of these \"forbidden symmetries\" and other related patterns. His talk is illustrated with numerous examples of their use in architectural design including a novel version of \"Penrose tiling\" that appears in the approach to the main entrance of the new Mathematics Institute in Oxford, officially opened in late 2013 (http:\/\/www.maths.ox.ac.uk\/new-building). \n\nThe tiling is constructed from several thousand diamond-shaped granite tiles of just two different shapes, decorated simply with circular arcs of stainless steel. The matching of the tiles forces them into an overall pattern which never repeats itself and exhibits remarkable aspects of 5-fold and 10-fold symmetry.\n\nSimilar features have been found also in the atomic structures of quasi-crystalline materials. The initial discovery of such material earned Dan Shectman the 2011 Nobel Prize for chemistry, his work having launched a completely novel area of crystallography. \n\nThe filming and production of this event was supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council: http:\/\/www.stfc.ac.uk.
