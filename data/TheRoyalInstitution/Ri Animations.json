And the deeper we look, the more symmetries we find, reflecting our world in new and beautiful ways. \n Subscribe for weekly science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\n\nSymmetry is vital to understanding and predicting how our universe works. The relationship between symmetry and the mechanics of the universe is fundamental to physics. From Noether\u2019s theorem to the new and exciting world of local symmetries being revealed by modern day physics, Tara Shears explores the physics of symmetry.\n\nBy revealing nature\u2019s parameters, symmetry gives definition to the world as we understand it. It is a fundamental principle that makes phenomena repeatable and predictable.  But if symmetries are so pervasive and influential in our world, why do we see so much asymmetry and chaos?\n\nThis animation was produced by Rosanna Wan, our 2016-17 animator-in-residence, supported by the Sfumato Foundation.\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwhNhy8qucR15N1_X1iZJzv","position":0,"publishedAt":"2017-06-14T13:34:20.000Z","title":"What is Symmetry in Physics?

A evolving negotiation over toy blocks between a mother and son comes together to illustrate the first law of thermodynamics. \n\nThere are many ways to describe the first law of thermodynamics, and many ways to explain it. In this unique animation, chemist Andrea Sella recalls one of Richard Feynman\u2019s descriptions of the law. In a classic analogy, Feynman imagines a child with a set of building blocks, and a mother struggling to ensure he doesn\u2019t lose any. Each day, the total number of blocks remains the same, although some do stray from their original location. \n\nThis consistent fact \u2013 that the blocks cannot be created or destroyed \u2013 allows the mother to calculate how many blocks are in a box without even looking. And this consistent fact, that energy itself is also always conserved, lays the foundation for one of physics\u2019 greatest rules.\n\nThe 2016 advent calendar explores the four laws of thermodynamics with a new short film each day, with explosive demonstrations, unique animations, and even a musical number.

The idea contradicted almost everything scientists thought at the time, and it took the detailed work of a brilliant cartographer to prove him right.\n\nConventional ideas held that the ocean floors were flat, featureless planes. As expeditions started to go around the world collecting ocean depth measurements, Marie Tharp \u2013 not allowed to join the expeditions herself \u2013 processed the data and began to craft detailed, revealing maps of the hidden ocean depths. \n\nShe discovered that the ocean floor was in fact a complex assortment of peaks and troughs. In particular, her profiles revealed stark rift valleys, which supported Wegener\u2019s controversial ideas. Even then, it took a long time to convince the scientific community that her findings were correct. Eventually, however, she was proved right, and Marie Tharp took her rightful place as one of history\u2019s finest cartographers. \n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwhNhy8qucR15N1_X1iZJzv","position":3,"publishedAt":"2016-11-16T09:16:35.000Z","title":"Marie Tharp: Uncovering the Secrets of the Ocean Floor - with Helen Czerski","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"TgfYjS0OTWw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"TgfYjS0OTWw","videoPublishedAt":"2016-11-16T09:16:35.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/3UNMM1Zv2m6QQtZHP-BiZSCtL2k\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad2hOaHk4cXVjUjE1TjFfWDFpWkp6di45NDk1REZENzhEMzU5MDQz","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"How do you go about designing a particle accelerator?

In general conversation, a \u2018theory\u2019 might simply mean a guess. But a scientific theory respects a somewhat stricter set of requirements. When scientists discuss theories, they are designed as comprehensive explanations for things we observe in nature. They\u2019re founded on strong evidence and provide ways to make real-world predictions that can be tested.\n\nWhile scientific theories aren\u2019t necessarily all accurate or true, they shouldn\u2019t be belittled by their name alone. The theory of natural selection, quantum theory, the theory of general relativity and the germ theory of disease aren\u2019t \u2018just theories\u2019. They\u2019re structured explanations of the world around us, and the very foundation of science itself.\n\nRead the blog post to find out more: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/blog\/2014\/november\/its-just-a-theory\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwhNhy8qucR15N1_X1iZJzv","position":9,"publishedAt":"2016-04-11T11:04:03.000Z","title":"Why science is NOT 'Just a Theory'","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1uzsuCFUQ68\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1uzsuCFUQ68\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1uzsuCFUQ68\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1uzsuCFUQ68\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1uzsuCFUQ68\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"1uzsuCFUQ68"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"1uzsuCFUQ68","videoPublishedAt":"2014-11-12T15:08:33.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/KWUJQEzt728U3QQfIol9r0c3B_g\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad2hOaHk4cXVjUjE1TjFfWDFpWkp6di4wOTA3OTZBNzVEMTUzOTMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"A two-minute animated adventure to Ancient Greece and back again - voiced by Numberphile's James Grime!  \n\nOften called the \"birthplace of civilisation\", Ancient Greece heralded numerous advances in philosophy, science, sport and also mathematics. Over six centuries from 600 BC a group of revolutionary thinkers -- from Thales, Pythagoras, Democritus and Aristotle to Euclid, Archimedes and Hypatia of Alexandria -- formalised the rules and language of modern mathematics. \n\nFor Greek thinkers, maths wasn't simply a means of calculating amounts but a way of testing reality and understanding the true nature of the world around them. Indeed, Pythagoras is believed to have coined both the words \"philosophy\" (\"love of wisdom\") and \"mathematics\" (\"that which is learned\"). In turn, Euclid came to be known as the \"father of geometry\". \n\nAt the heart of this new understanding, was the concept of \"the proof\", developed by Euclid in what is commonly regarded as the most important and successful mathematical textbook of all time -- the \"Stoicheion\" or \"Elements\". Built upon the axiomatic method, mathematical proofs were a way of testing assumptions by building up a mathematical argument using self-evident or assumed statements (or, \"axioms\"). \n\nIt is this methodology that formed the foundational language and logic of modern mathematics throughout the world.  Indeed, Euclid's Elements was widely used as the seminal maths textbook right up until the start of the twentieth century. \n\nMany thanks to James Grime for his expert help on the script and recording the voice-over.
