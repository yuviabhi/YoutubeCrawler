Cognitive neuroscientist Jon Simons considers the latest evidence.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nWatch the Q&A here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/QPuOr6_4GhA\n\nThe ability to remember personally experienced events in vivid, multisensory detail makes an immensely important contribution to our lives, allowing us to re-live each moment of a previous encounter and providing us with the store of precious memories that form the building blocks of who we are. Such remembering involves reactivating sensory and perceptual features of an event, and the thoughts and feelings we had when the event occurred, integrating them into a conscious first-person experience. It allows us to make judgments about the things we remember, such as distinguishing events that actually occurred from those we might have imagined or been told about. Although a great deal is known about the cognitive and neural processes that enable us to recall a word list, for example, considerably less is known about the processes underlying the subjective experience of remembering.\n\nJon Simons is a reader in Cognitive Neuroscience at Cambridge University. His research investigates the role of brain regions such as the frontal, medial temporal, and parietal lobes in human memory.\n\nHis research in the laboratory uses a number of methods, including behavioural studies, functional neuroimaging (fMRI), electrophysiology (EEG\/MEG), and brain stimulation (TMS\/tDCS).\n\nThis talk and Q&A were filmed at the Ri on 23 March 2018.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwT_sW6joezEWrkVYX8dPa3","position":3,"publishedAt":"2018-05-09T10:52:25.000Z","title":"What Makes a Memory Come Alive? - with Jon Simons","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h-2vuT1fRbw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h-2vuT1fRbw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h-2vuT1fRbw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h-2vuT1fRbw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h-2vuT1fRbw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"h-2vuT1fRbw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"h-2vuT1fRbw","videoPublishedAt":"2018-05-09T14:14:20.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/tYrChZsx9MPDu4amM88R6lkzs4s\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad1Rfc1c2am9lekVXcmtWWVg4ZFBhMy41NkI0NEY2RDEwNTU3Q0M2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Cognitive science sees the brain as a sort of computer, but how does education redesign these cerebral computers?

Why do we need sleep and what are the physiological processes driving our circadian rhythm? When is our circadian clock disrupted and how does this affect our health? Cognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs the debate.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe science behind sleeplessness can help us understand our rhythms so we can live better and healthier lives. While hormones, such a melatonin, play a role in driving our circadian clock, the amount of sleep we get and our sleep cycles also affect our hormonal release patterns, with far-reaching implications on our health.\nCognitive neuroscientist Vincent Walsh chairs a discussion with a panel of experts who specialise in circadian rhythms. They explore how light detection plays a role in our sleep-wake cycles, how hormone release is regulated and the implications of changes to our circadian clock and sleeplessness over time.\n\nThis event was supported by British Psychological Society and Society for Endocrinology.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwT_sW6joezEWrkVYX8dPa3","position":9,"publishedAt":"2017-11-02T15:18:26.000Z","title":"The Science of Sleep: Melatonin to Neural Pathways","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0Uzy35uJzU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0Uzy35uJzU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0Uzy35uJzU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0Uzy35uJzU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/O0Uzy35uJzU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"O0Uzy35uJzU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"O0Uzy35uJzU","videoPublishedAt":"2016-06-29T08:00:00.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/XCgjFvGdfshijiR_5_-AqOzFM8A\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad1Rfc1c2am9lekVXcmtWWVg4ZFBhMy5EMEEwRUY5M0RDRTU3NDJC","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"In a lightning tour of human reasoning, world-renowned psychologist Richard Nisbett shines a new light on the shadowy world of the way we think \u2013 and how we can make our lives, and the lives of those around us, better.\nWatch the Q&A here: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=V2Ci4ro75fM\n\nRichard Nisbett is Theodore M.

Or has neuroscience become misappropriated to justify gender gaps? Professor of cognitive neuroimaging Gina Rippon investigates.\nSubscribe for weekly science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\nWatch the Q&A: https:\/\/youtu.be\/1swI97JbuUA\n\nThere is a long history of debate about biological sex differences and their part in determining gender roles, with the \u2018biology is destiny\u2019 mantra being used to legitimise imbalances in these roles. The tradition is continuing, with new brain imaging techniques being hailed as sources of evidence of the \u2018essential\u2019 differences between men and women, and the concept of \u2018hardwiring\u2019 sneaking into popular parlance as a brain-based explanation for all kinds of gender gaps. \n\nBut the field is littered with many problems. Some are the product of ill-informed popular science writing (neurotrash) based on the misunderstanding or misrepresentation of what brain imaging can tell us. Some, unfortunately involve poor science, with scientists using outdated and disproved stereotypes to design and interpret their research (neurosexism). These problems obscure or ignore the \u2018neuronews\u2019, the breakthroughs in our understanding of how plastic and permeable our brains are, and how the concept of \u2018hard-wiring\u2019 should be condemned to the dustbin of neurohistory. \n\nThis talk aims to offer ways of rooting out the neurotrash, stamping out the neurosexism and making way for neuronews.\nGina Rippon is Professor of Cognitive Neuroimaging at Aston University. Her research involves the application of brain imaging techniques, particularly electroencephalography, (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG), to studies of normal and abnormal cognitive processes.     \n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwT_sW6joezEWrkVYX8dPa3","position":11,"publishedAt":"2017-11-02T15:23:23.000Z","title":"How Neurononsense Keeps Women in Their Place - with Gina Rippon","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uqR4cw9Amlg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uqR4cw9Amlg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uqR4cw9Amlg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uqR4cw9Amlg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uqR4cw9Amlg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"uqR4cw9Amlg"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"uqR4cw9Amlg","videoPublishedAt":"2016-06-01T07:48:11.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/FyWAceExwEztUfm6x7FlfQ1rlwY\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad1Rfc1c2am9lekVXcmtWWVg4ZFBhMy5EQUE1NTFDRjcwMDg0NEMz","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Subscribe for the latest science videos:\n http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nIf you ask people what makes them laugh, they will tell you they laugh at jokes: however if you look at when they laugh a very different pattern emerges, in which laughter can be seen as an extremely important social emotion. \n\nIn this Ri event, Sophie Scott explores the science of laughter, from laughter in other animals to the acoustics of laughter, and the ways that laughter is processed in our brains.\n\nThe science of laughter was presented at the Ri on Friday 28 March 2014.\n\nThis event is part of our all-women line up for Friday Evening Discourses in 2014 as part of our year long celebration of women in science. \n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwT_sW6joezEWrkVYX8dPa3","position":12,"publishedAt":"2017-11-06T10:17:14.000Z","title":"The Science of Laughter with Sophie Scott","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4BWRoHGiwrw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4BWRoHGiwrw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4BWRoHGiwrw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4BWRoHGiwrw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4BWRoHGiwrw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"4BWRoHGiwrw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"4BWRoHGiwrw","videoPublishedAt":"2014-06-11T08:10:21.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Dr63-3HSVSb8gsq5xWTPWbRUuRs\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad1Rfc1c2am9lekVXcmtWWVg4ZFBhMy41QTY1Q0UxMTVCODczNThE","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"There are two demos in this talk that you can try at home exploring how we perceive and recollect visual scenes:\n\n1. Image distance demo:\nYou are given a 3 second countdown before seeing a quick sequence of two pictures of the same object, divided briefly by a visual mask. The challenge is to identify whether the second picture is the same view as the first, or whether it's moved closer or further away. Try it yourself http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gdzmNwTLakg&t=6m56s\n\n2. Drawing from memory demo:\nYou have 15 seconds to look at a picture, which you'll then be asked to draw, as accurately as possible, from memory. Try it now http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=gdzmNwTLakg&t=35m20s\n\n\nOur memories are our lives, and a fundamental basis of our culture. Collective memoirs of the past both bind society together and shape our potential future. With our brains we can travel through time and space, calling to mind places of significance, evoking images and emotions of past experiences. It's no wonder, then, that we so desperately fear the prospect of memory loss.\n\nMany regions of the brain are involved in memory, but one of the most critical components is the hippocampus, which plays a crucial role in the formation of long-term memories. Damage to the hippocampus can therefore result in significant memory loss.\n\nIn this Friday Evening Discourse, Eleanor Maguire draws on evidence from virtual reality, brain imaging and studies of amnesia to show that the consequences of hippocampal damage are even more far-reaching than suspected, robbing us of our past, our imagination and altering our perception of the world.\n\nMaguire also explains how, despite our beliefs, our memories are not actually as accurate as you might think. In fact, they're not really even about the past.\n\nThis event is part of our all-women line up for Friday Evening Discourses in 2014 as part of our year long celebration of women in science.
