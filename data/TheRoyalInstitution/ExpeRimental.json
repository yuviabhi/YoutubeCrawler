Here are five simple ways to get the most out of the activities with your kids.\nWe have 30 fun, free experiments to try: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/families\/experimental\n\nOur top 5 tips:\n1 - Don't worry if you don't know the science! When doing our activities for kids ages 4-10, It's not about facts and figures, it's about asking questions, investigating the world, and thinking.\n2 - Play, look, ask. This is a great structure to keep in mind when doing an experiment. Have fun, look closely, and question everything you see.\n3 - Ask the right questions. Asking questions is the most important thing about doing these activities, and asking the right ones can help your child get the most out of them. Rather than simple 'yes\/no' questions, try to encourage them to think for themselves. Instead of 'do you think this will happen', try 'what do you think will happen'. It's a subtle difference, but has a big impact.\n4 - Go off script! We've provided a set of instructions, but don't feel you need to stick to them. Try other things, do it your own way, and importantly, let the kids try out any ideas of their own.\n5 - Don't worry if it doesn't work! Science experiments, whether in a kitchen or a laboratory, often don't quite work. Don't worry! Use that as part of the investigation. Get the kids thinking about why it didn't work? What could you change to improve it? The experiments aren't about the final results, they're about the process.\n\nThis series of ExpeRimental is supported by the British Psychological Society: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/about\/news\/spring-2017\/bps-experimental\n\nTry all of our ExpeRiments here, let us know how you get on! http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/families\/experimental\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwQDZ7PR50NLf0xMMOklTxc","position":1,"publishedAt":"2017-07-05T08:54:46.000Z","title":"Science Experiments For Kids - Top 5 Tips!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"xLmYEuEhYzU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"xLmYEuEhYzU","videoPublishedAt":"2017-07-06T13:31:22.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/8_rojHa9HPzzPEZFkwFmwoqLTHs\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad1FEWjdQUjUwTkxmMHhNTU9rbFR4Yy42MTI4Njc2QjM1RjU1MjlG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Learn to make splatter pictures and experiment with trying to spot hidden images in random patterns.\nDownload the infosheet here for more instructions: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/families\/experimental\/multitasking-mayhem\n\nOur brains are constantly trying to make sense of the world around us.

This activity is all about understanding a bit more about how these work, and why our brains perceive what is actually a series of still images as flowing motion.\n\nBy making a thaumatrope, you can learn about 'persistence of vision', as two images pass by your eyes so quickly that you are still processing one when you see the next, so your brain merges the two together to see a complete image.\n\nA phenakistoscope works just like classic animation and movies. By rapidly showing one image after the other, each slightly different to the one before, a sense of movement is created.

They explore how doing different things to cream results in different products, learning about how physical actions can affect the consistency of a substance. To make butter, they shake a jar of double cream that has been left out overnight. As they shake, they feel a change in consistency, and are soon left with a solid lump of butter and a little buttermilk. Whipped cream is made by simply whisking cold cream until it becomes foamy.\n\nThe girls learn that milk and cream are composed mainly of water and fat. The shaking and whisking causes fat globules to interact with each other. When making butter, the fat molecules break free from their globules, and join together to form butter. Whisking adds air to cream, breaking apart the fat globules. It forms protective bubbles around tiny pockets of air and changes the consistency of the cream. \n\nThis series of ExpeRimental is supported by the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nThis is the second of three special ExpeRimental films released in British Science Week.\n\nExpeRimental, brought to you by the Royal Institution of Great Britain, is a series of free short films that make it fun, easy and cheap to do science at home with children aged 4 to 10.

These simple chemical reactions introduce the idea that substances can react together to make a new substance, and are an excellent starting point for looking closely at the world around us. This experiment can be a little messy, but that's part of the fun.\n\nWhen bicarbonate of soda reacts with substances like vinegar, carbon dioxide is given off as a gas, which forms the bubbles you see as the reaction fizzes.

Watch the flakes shoot across the water at the touch of a finger. They experiment with different liquids, investigating how substances around the house affect the surface of water. The dramatic effect you see is because the soap weakens the pull that water molecules have on each other. As a result, as the soap spreads over the surface of the water, the water is able to pull away, taking the oregano or pepper with it.\n\nThis amazing trick can be used to make a great activity. Cut a boat shape out of a drinks carton, with a little space at the back (for the \u2018engine\u2019). When you add a drop of soap in the hole, it pushes water out, backwards. The water moving out the back of the boat pushes it forward, just as hot gases coming out of the bottom of a rocket push it upwards.\n\nDownload our boat templates and info sheet and race some boats yourself.

In this activity you and your kids will look for familiar shapes in random patterns, and learn about how our brains process the things we see.\n\nWe can create simple but beautiful splatter images by dotting paint onto one half of a sheet of paper and folding it over. After opening it up there will be a completely random pattern, yet we as humans have the ability to spot countless familiar features in it.\n\nWe see shapes and objects in the random patterns because our brains are so well designed to spot and remember objects and animals in real life. It\u2019s sort of a short-cut our brains use to quickly process the world, but it can sometimes mean we see things in unexpected places.\n\nThis series of ExpeRimental is supported by the British Psychological Society: https:\/\/beta.bps.org.uk\/\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwQDZ7PR50NLf0xMMOklTxc","position":35,"publishedAt":"2017-07-06T08:50:56.000Z","title":"Seeing Shapes in Inkblots - Psychology For Kids - Experimental #29","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9j-WdPIz2rU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9j-WdPIz2rU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9j-WdPIz2rU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9j-WdPIz2rU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9j-WdPIz2rU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"9j-WdPIz2rU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"9j-WdPIz2rU","videoPublishedAt":"2017-06-29T14:43:25.000Z"}}]}
