She is also a founding member of the European Women in Mathematics (EWM), which aims to support and encourage female mathematicians across Europe. \nThis was filmed at a Friday Evening Discourse at the Royal Institution on 28 November 2014.\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyDfeVsNBMNDUu-o5j9_QMb","position":9,"publishedAt":"2017-11-02T16:26:46.000Z","title":"Topology, Geometry and Life in Three Dimensions","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/K60F97qChKg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/K60F97qChKg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/K60F97qChKg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/K60F97qChKg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/K60F97qChKg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"K60F97qChKg"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"K60F97qChKg","videoPublishedAt":"2015-02-11T13:01:03.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ABmhBPCrsnXS-CLtBn9pfNy_JMw\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeURmZVZzTkJNTkRVdS1vNWo5X1FNYi45ODRDNTg0QjA4NkFBNkQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Professor Alan Davies presents a series of groundbreaking experiments pioneered by the Ancient Greeks. Often called the \"birthplace of civilisation\", Ancient Greece heralded numerous advances in philosophy, science, engineering and mathematics which have shaped our understanding of the modern world.\n\nAssisted by Ri demo technician, Andy Marmery, Professor Davies demonstrates the key discoveries and experiments of many Greek thinkers -- from Thales and Pythagoras to Euclid, Archimedes and Hypatia of Alexandria.\n\nThis video was created as part of the Greek Legacy series of events, generously supported by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation (http:\/\/www.snf.org).\n\nThe conference for sixth form students, held on Friday 6th March 2014, was a day of interaction and discovery - from exploring the astrolabe and the steam engine to exclaiming \"Eureka!\" and asking \"How did they do that?\". Alongside Professor Davies' demonstrations, talks were presented on Euclid and Hypatia. The audience discovered how the Greek Philosophers established the foundation of modern mathematics through the concept of  proof, and students from Imperial College presented Greeks: The Musical!\n\nPlus, there was the first ever public-screening of the Ri animation, The Greek Legacy.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyDfeVsNBMNDUu-o5j9_QMb","position":10,"publishedAt":"2017-11-06T10:18:47.000Z","title":"How Greek Maths Changed the World","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F97UvxQWqrk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F97UvxQWqrk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F97UvxQWqrk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F97UvxQWqrk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F97UvxQWqrk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"F97UvxQWqrk"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"F97UvxQWqrk","videoPublishedAt":"2014-05-14T15:22:35.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Lqq_RfdlH4ZvMzmekYjZ6iSgltE\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeURmZVZzTkJNTkRVdS1vNWo5X1FNYi41Mzk2QTAxMTkzNDk4MDhF","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Sir Roger Penrose provides a unique insight into the \"forbidden symmetry\" of his famous penrose tiles and the use of non-repeating patterns in design and architecture. \n\nIt is a rigorous mathematical theorem that the only crystallographic symmetries are 2-fold, 3-fold, 4-fold, and 6-fold symmetries.\n\nYet, since the 1970s 5-fold, 8-fold, 10-fold and 12-fold \"almost\" symmetric patterns have been exhibited, showing that such crystallographically \"forbidden symmetries\" are mathematically possible and deviate from exact symmetry by an arbitrarily small amount. Such patterns are often beautiful to behold and designs based on these arrangements have now been used in many buildings throughout the world.\n\nIn this Ri event Sir Roger Penrose reveals the mathematical underpinnings and origins of these \"forbidden symmetries\" and other related patterns. His talk is illustrated with numerous examples of their use in architectural design including a novel version of \"Penrose tiling\" that appears in the approach to the main entrance of the new Mathematics Institute in Oxford, officially opened in late 2013 (http:\/\/www.maths.ox.ac.uk\/new-building). \n\nThe tiling is constructed from several thousand diamond-shaped granite tiles of just two different shapes, decorated simply with circular arcs of stainless steel. The matching of the tiles forces them into an overall pattern which never repeats itself and exhibits remarkable aspects of 5-fold and 10-fold symmetry.\n\nSimilar features have been found also in the atomic structures of quasi-crystalline materials. The initial discovery of such material earned Dan Shectman the 2011 Nobel Prize for chemistry, his work having launched a completely novel area of crystallography. \n\nImages of the completed Mathematics Institute in Oxford courtesy of Vanesa Penrose.\n\nThe filming and production of this event was supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council: http:\/\/www.stfc.ac.uk.
