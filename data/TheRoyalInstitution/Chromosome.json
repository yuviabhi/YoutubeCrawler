The Royal Institution announces its 2013 online advent calendar...\n\nThis year's Ri advent series is an ambitious video journey through the human genome. Inspired by the forthcoming 'Life Fantastic' CHRISTMAS LECTURES with Dr Alison Woollard, we'll release a different video each day between 1 December and Christmas Eve. The short films will explore the 23 pairs of human chromosomes and the mitochondrial DNA that make up the building blocks of human life.\n\nHighlights include geneticist Dr Adam Rutherford exploring what 'junk' DNA is, a light-hearted look at male baldness with former Christmas lecturer Mark Miodownik, and a visit to Alison's lab at the University of Oxford to learn more about the genetic control of ageing. We'll explain Nobel Prize winning science, take a trip to the zoo and delve into the mysteries of ginger hair.\n\nThe series will also raise awareness of several rare and not-so-rare genetic disorders such as Alkaptonuria (AKU) as well as other more well known diseases with a hereditary link including breast cancer. Through interviews with experts and personal stories we'll reveal the genetic secrets behind these conditions and highlight the latest cutting-edge research to help prevent, treat and manage them.\n\nWith thanks to BBSRC: http:\/\/bbsrc.ac.uk\/\n\nDon't miss the 2013 CHRISTMAS LECTURES on BBC Four and BBC iPlayer: http:\/\/rigb.org\/christmas-lectures\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZzmKKvdLUKVGpaQeg4tVrPi","position":0,"publishedAt":"2013-11-29T12:14:18.000Z","title":"Chromosome Trailer - Ri Advent Calendar 2013","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DyXBCjnry4s\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DyXBCjnry4s\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DyXBCjnry4s\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DyXBCjnry4s\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"DyXBCjnry4s"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"DyXBCjnry4s","videoPublishedAt":"2013-11-29T12:14:11.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/QluQhILH25L3sj4fmxMiP90Bawk\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaem1LS3ZkTFVLVkdwYVFlZzR0VnJQaS4yODlGNEE0NkRGMEEzMEQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"EXPLORE THE RI ADVENT CALENDAR: http:\/\/rigb.org\/advent\n\nGeneticist Aoife Mclysaght introduces the Ri advent calendar 2013 - our video journey through the human genome.

It turns out, however, that we still don't fully understand how these genetic sequences code for all that we see around us, and that there is a whole extra layer of information to our genetic code called \"epigenetics\". \n\nEpigenetic markers on our DNA influence the way in which genes are \"read\", rather like punctuation in a sentence, determining whether a particular gene will be expressed or not. We usually have two \"switched on\" copies of each gene (one from each parent), but this is not always the case. Fatima Santos, from The Babraham Institute explains how Chromosome 11 has helped us to understand how epigenetic markers can result in certain DNA sequences being expressed in one cell and not in another.

Understanding more about the process by which blood clots form not only helps us to intervene in this process for medical benefits, but also gives an insight into the nature of several rare but significant diseases which affect bleeding. \n\nOne example of this is a disease called Von Willebrand, related to a gene of the same name on chromosome 12, where the absence of a specific biomolecule leads to problems with prolonged bleeding.

DNA often gets damaged by everyday processes within our bodies, but also from external factors such as UV radiation or tobacco smoke. Luckily, our bodies are well equipped to fix this damage thanks, in part, to the BRCA2 gene, found on chromosome 13.\n\nBRCA2 encodes for a large protein which carries out repair work on damaged DNA. It's no surprise then that if the BRCA2 is faulty, or missing, our cells can't repair themselves properly. As a result, the damaged DNA builds up and this can lead to cancer.\n\nIn turns out, however, that faults on BRCA2 aren't necessarily such an advantage to cancer cells. As their BRCA2 gene is faulty, the only remaining \"tool\" in a cancer cell's molecular repair kit is another gene known as PARP. Dr Kat Arney from Cancer Research UK explains how by using drugs to block PARP function, scientists are hoping to prevent cancer cells from repairing themselves, causing them to die off. Whilst developing cancer treatments is certainly no piece of cake, drugs with PARP inhibitors are already showing great promise in trials.\n\nYou can find out more about research into PARP inhibitors on the Cancer Research UK science blog at the following links:\nhttp:\/\/scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org\/2008\/07\/10\/a-%E2%80%98lethal-weapon%E2%80%99-in-the-search-for-new-cancer-treatments\/\n\nhttp:\/\/scienceblog.cancerresearchuk.org\/2011\/07\/12\/widening-the-net-for-parp-inhibitors\/\n\nFor more information on related cancer research visit: www.cruk.org\n\nWith thanks to BBSRC: http:\/\/bbsrc.ac.uk\/\n\nDon't miss the 2013 CHRISTMAS LECTURES on BBC Four and BBC iPlayer: http:\/\/rigb.org\/christmas-lectures\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZzmKKvdLUKVGpaQeg4tVrPi","position":13,"publishedAt":"2013-12-13T07:27:35.000Z","title":"Chromosome 13 - BRCA2 and DNA Damage","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qnTPEvrbtsc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qnTPEvrbtsc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/qnTPEvrbtsc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"qnTPEvrbtsc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"qnTPEvrbtsc","videoPublishedAt":"2013-12-13T07:27:25.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/WQQXRo2ER9FtsV6Rp1-opq_LLN0\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaem1LS3ZkTFVLVkdwYVFlZzR0VnJQaS41Mzk2QTAxMTkzNDk4MDhF","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"EXPLORE THE RI ADVENT CALENDAR: http:\/\/rigb.org.uk\/advent \n\nIn order to defend our bodies, our immune system has to be able to recognise and destroy an incredibly vast number of pathogens.

We typically inherit 23 pairs of chromosomes from our parents, but when mistakes occur in the process of meiosis (the formation of sperm and egg cells) some sex cells can end up with two copies of the same chromosome. The chromosome that this usually occurs with is chromosome 21. When that sex cell then fuses with another to form an embryo, that embryo inherits 3 copies of chromosome 21 (one from one parent, and two from another) meaning that it has 47 chromosomes instead of 46. As chromosome 21 is one of the shortest chromosomes the embryo can survive this duplication, but the result is a condition called Down's Syndrome, which causes developmental and physical disabilities. TV presenter and biologist Dr Yan Wong explains how this process occurs.\n\nWith thanks to BBSRC: http:\/\/bbsrc.ac.uk\/\n\nDon't miss the 2013 CHRISTMAS LECTURES on BBC Four and BBC iPlayer: http:\/\/rigb.org\/christmas-lectures\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZzmKKvdLUKVGpaQeg4tVrPi","position":21,"publishedAt":"2013-12-21T08:30:19.000Z","title":"Chromosome 21 - How accidental inheritance can lead to Downs syndrome","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wtebnV_QFQU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wtebnV_QFQU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wtebnV_QFQU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wtebnV_QFQU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"wtebnV_QFQU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"wtebnV_QFQU","videoPublishedAt":"2013-12-21T08:30:39.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/STuZDJ8GBIm4faQjV3X2lMkdTs8\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaem1LS3ZkTFVLVkdwYVFlZzR0VnJQaS4zRjM0MkVCRTg0MkYyQTM0","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"EXPLORE THE RI ADVENT CALENDAR: http:\/\/rigb.org.uk\/advent \n\nOne of the proteins in our bodies, called myoglobin, is a vital factor in the biochemical reactions that fuel our everyday activities.\n\nEncoded for by a gene on chromosome 22, myoglobin extracts oxygen from our red blood cells and stores it in our muscles -- helping to keep us moving.
