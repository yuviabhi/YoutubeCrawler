Cognitive neuroscientist Jon Simons considers the latest evidence.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nWatch the Q&A here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/QPuOr6_4GhA\n\nThe ability to remember personally experienced events in vivid, multisensory detail makes an immensely important contribution to our lives, allowing us to re-live each moment of a previous encounter and providing us with the store of precious memories that form the building blocks of who we are. Such remembering involves reactivating sensory and perceptual features of an event, and the thoughts and feelings we had when the event occurred, integrating them into a conscious first-person experience. It allows us to make judgments about the things we remember, such as distinguishing events that actually occurred from those we might have imagined or been told about. Although a great deal is known about the cognitive and neural processes that enable us to recall a word list, for example, considerably less is known about the processes underlying the subjective experience of remembering.\n\nJon Simons is a reader in Cognitive Neuroscience at Cambridge University. His research investigates the role of brain regions such as the frontal, medial temporal, and parietal lobes in human memory.\n\nHis research in the laboratory uses a number of methods, including behavioural studies, functional neuroimaging (fMRI), electrophysiology (EEG\/MEG), and brain stimulation (TMS\/tDCS).\n\nThis talk and Q&A were filmed at the Ri on 23 March 2018.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwA1mQM34cYRcfJcxPcTCSf","position":0,"publishedAt":"2018-05-18T11:32:50.000Z","title":"What Makes a Memory Come Alive? - with Jon Simons","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h-2vuT1fRbw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h-2vuT1fRbw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h-2vuT1fRbw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h-2vuT1fRbw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/h-2vuT1fRbw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"h-2vuT1fRbw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"h-2vuT1fRbw","videoPublishedAt":"2018-05-09T14:14:20.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Gwajto3BXI1cquJvDjf8kh6R4kY\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad0ExbVFNMzRjWVJjZkpjeFBjVENTZi4yODlGNEE0NkRGMEEzMEQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Last year the Cassini-Huygens spacecraft mission ended its 20 years in space by burning up in Saturn\u2019s atmosphere (on purpose).
