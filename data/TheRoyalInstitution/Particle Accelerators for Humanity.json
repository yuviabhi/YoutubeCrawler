Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen used a cathode ray tube to generate X-rays. It didn\u2019t take long for the destructive power of these rays to be turned to medicinal benefit. X-rays kill cancer cells through ionization. By stripping electrons from water molecules, the X-ray photons leave a highly chemically reactive wake. The reactive water molecules bind to, and destroy, DNA.\n\nBut X-ray beams don\u2019t differentiate between healthy and cancerous cells, so their destructive force is hard to localize to the problem zones alone. One option is to use protons, rather than X-ray photons. Particle accelerators can take protons from inside a Hydrogen atom, form them into high energy beams and more specifically target a tumour.\n\nHowever, instead of passing through the body like X-ray photons, the protons stop at the tumour, thanks to a phenomenon called the \u2018Bragg peak\u2019. By tuning the energy of a proton beam, the dose can be much more carefully controlled.\n\nThis video is supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council.

But how are those particles controlled? With the help of two visual demonstrations, Suzie Sheehy explains.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nWatch Suzie's lecture on her research and the future of particle accelerators: https:\/\/youtu.be\/jLmciZdh5j4\nAnd watch our film on how to power a particle accelerator: https:\/\/youtu.be\/-F9EqYLQKYI\n\nKeeping a handle on particles is key to the huge range of applications particle accelerators have. The machines accelerate beams of particles using electric and magnetic fields. Suzie uses a \u2018Paul trap\u2019 to show how rapidly oscillating currents are used to keep particles on track. A ball on the saddle apparatus is kept in the centre by the rising sides. But that only controls the ball in one direction, meaning it can drop off. Magnetic or electric fields are similar, and can only direct particles in one plane at a time. When the kit begins to spin, though, the alternating position of the rising sides means the ball is contained in the center. This has the same effect that quadrupole magnets in an accelerator have, constantly alternating gradients to keep particles in line.\n\nUsing a more sophisticated setup, a quadrupole linear Paul trap, pollen grains can be held in place in a beam just as particles in an accelerator would be. Oscillating fields established across rods on opposite corners of the system keep the pollen particles trapped. Without the rapidly changing fields, the particles would just shoot off in one direction; it\u2019s the changes that keep them from escaping in one or the other direction.\n\nThese simple analogies show how particle accelerators guide particles into focused beams, to be harnessed for a huge range of applications.\n\nThis video is supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZx0mVe9wGxg5kyKdofRJJ7m","position":5,"publishedAt":"2016-08-25T08:13:45.000Z","title":"How To Trap Particles in a Particle Accelerator","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"LR_aNOcnH0Q"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"LR_aNOcnH0Q","videoPublishedAt":"2016-08-25T08:13:44.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/AWB0i_JHpsyvw9dG_xed1GQFD3E\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeDBtVmU5d0d4ZzVreUtkb2ZSSko3bS4wMTcyMDhGQUE4NTIzM0Y5","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"How do you power a particle accelerator firing beams of protons 50 times a second into a heavy metal target?
