According to Faraday's notes of the lecture, a volcano was built out of clay and gravel and pieces of the highly reactive metal potassium were placed into the crater and the fissures at the sides. Davy then poured water into the fissures. Water reacts with potassium, producing potassium hydroxide and the highly flammable hydrogen gas. While we now know that this is not the mechanism behind volcanic eruptions as Davy suggested, the experiment is still a spectacular demonstration of a natural phenomenon, and at the time, cemented Davy's status are one of the most engaging lecturers or his era.\n\nTo find out more about Humphry Davy's life, his scientific accomplishments and his poetry, join the free online course by Lancaster University - Humphry Davy: Laughing Gas, Literature, and the Lamp https:\/\/www.futurelearn.com\/courses\/humphry-davy\/1 \n\nVideo copyright: Lancaster University\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":2,"publishedAt":"2017-10-12T15:51:50.000Z","title":"Humphry Davy's Potassium Volcano","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nxRHQ1xfnWc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nxRHQ1xfnWc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nxRHQ1xfnWc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nxRHQ1xfnWc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nxRHQ1xfnWc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"nxRHQ1xfnWc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"nxRHQ1xfnWc","videoPublishedAt":"2017-08-09T11:01:09.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/4lb8LMx6uzZMZT4JD5aqUyPTKz0\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC4wOTA3OTZBNzVEMTUzOTMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Doing science experiments with your children can be easy and fun. Here are five simple ways to get the most out of the activities with your kids.\nWe have 30 fun, free experiments to try: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/families\/experimental\n\nOur top 5 tips:\n1 - Don't worry if you don't know the science! When doing our activities for kids ages 4-10, It's not about facts and figures, it's about asking questions, investigating the world, and thinking.\n2 - Play, look, ask. This is a great structure to keep in mind when doing an experiment. Have fun, look closely, and question everything you see.\n3 - Ask the right questions. Asking questions is the most important thing about doing these activities, and asking the right ones can help your child get the most out of them. Rather than simple 'yes\/no' questions, try to encourage them to think for themselves. Instead of 'do you think this will happen', try 'what do you think will happen'. It's a subtle difference, but has a big impact.\n4 - Go off script! We've provided a set of instructions, but don't feel you need to stick to them. Try other things, do it your own way, and importantly, let the kids try out any ideas of their own.\n5 - Don't worry if it doesn't work! Science experiments, whether in a kitchen or a laboratory, often don't quite work. Don't worry! Use that as part of the investigation. Get the kids thinking about why it didn't work? What could you change to improve it? The experiments aren't about the final results, they're about the process.\n\nThis series of ExpeRimental is supported by the British Psychological Society: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/about\/news\/spring-2017\/bps-experimental\n\nTry all of our ExpeRiments here, let us know how you get on! http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/families\/experimental\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":3,"publishedAt":"2017-10-12T15:52:39.000Z","title":"Science Experiments For Kids - Top 5 Tips!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"xLmYEuEhYzU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"xLmYEuEhYzU","videoPublishedAt":"2017-07-06T13:31:22.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/cRSuJHqVPRRMBdx3wCLSWbGdG_k\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC4xMkVGQjNCMUM1N0RFNEUx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Learn to make splatter pictures and experiment with trying to spot hidden images in random patterns.\nDownload the infosheet here for more instructions: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/families\/experimental\/multitasking-mayhem\n\nOur brains are constantly trying to make sense of the world around us.

This activity is all about understanding a bit more about how these work, and why our brains perceive what is actually a series of still images as flowing motion.\n\nBy making a thaumatrope, you can learn about 'persistence of vision', as two images pass by your eyes so quickly that you are still processing one when you see the next, so your brain merges the two together to see a complete image.\n\nA phenakistoscope works just like classic animation and movies.

Experiment at home to see what combinations are hardest, and whether you can manage them with a bit of practise.\n\nThis series of ExpeRimental is supported by the British Psychological Society: https:\/\/beta.bps.org.uk\/\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":9,"publishedAt":"2017-10-12T16:11:03.000Z","title":"Why is Multitasking So Hard?

In this animation, particle accelerator physicist Suzie Sheehydiscusses why the first law of thermodynamics is so important to particle physics.\n\nTo describe the motion of almost any system, from a car on a road to particles in an accelerator, you have to be able to trust that certain quantities are conserved. From the simple rule that energy is conserved, you can deduct incredible information.\n\nIn a particle accelerator, particles are collided with each other, or with other matter. The result is a spray of the component particles, but some of these can\u2019t be detected by modern machines. For example, neutrinos have almost no mass and as such are almost impossible to directly detect. But because energy is always conserved, the physicists can tell what properties they haven\u2019t detected by calculating the difference between the initial input and the output they find.\n\nThe first law of thermodynamics gives a predictive power that lets scientists understand the world.\n\nThis video was supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council.\n\nThe 2016 advent calendar explores the four laws of thermodynamics with a new short film each day, with explosive demonstrations, unique animations, and even a musical number.

They\u2019re the most well known and frequently mentioned. But underpinning them all is a final law so fundamental that, although it was established last, had to be moved to the front of the list: the zeroth law. In the first film of our 2016 advent calendar, chemical engineer Valeska Ting explores the zeroth law of thermodynamics.\n\nThe zeroth law is essentially an observation: if two systems are both in thermal equilibrium with a third, they are also in equilibrium with each other.

The idea contradicted almost everything scientists thought at the time, and it took the detailed work of a brilliant cartographer to prove him right.\n\nConventional ideas held that the ocean floors were flat, featureless planes. As expeditions started to go around the world collecting ocean depth measurements, Marie Tharp \u2013 not allowed to join the expeditions herself \u2013 processed the data and began to craft detailed, revealing maps of the hidden ocean depths. \n\nShe discovered that the ocean floor was in fact a complex assortment of peaks and troughs. In particular, her profiles revealed stark rift valleys, which supported Wegener\u2019s controversial ideas. Even then, it took a long time to convince the scientific community that her findings were correct. Eventually, however, she was proved right, and Marie Tharp took her rightful place as one of history\u2019s finest cartographers. \n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":28,"publishedAt":"2017-10-13T11:22:18.000Z","title":"Marie Tharp: Uncovering the Secrets of the Ocean Floor - with Helen Czerski","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"TgfYjS0OTWw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"TgfYjS0OTWw","videoPublishedAt":"2016-11-16T09:16:35.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Mu04ELUrhpMQZK9AjzF3BinaHx8\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC41QUZGQTY5OTE4QTREQUU4","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Suzie Sheehy chairs a discussion between accelerator physicists from across the field on what\u2019s next for particle accelerators.\nWatch our full series on particle accelerators: https:\/\/youtu.be\/V_hirIK9eFs?list=PLbnrZHfNEDZx0mVe9wGxg5kyKdofRJJ7m\nWatch the Q&A that followed this event: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=XblwzEemP90\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nParticle accelerators seem to be getting bigger, more powerful and more expensive in the quest for knowledge that helps us understand the Universe.

Most techniques used to study proteins cannot take into account the presence of water. \n\nDr Sylvia McLain, a University Research Lecturer within the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Oxford, and her team are using the ISIS Neutron Source to test the role water plays in protein folding, and are finding that it may not be quite as passive at it seems.\n\nThis film is supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council.\n\nThanks to St Peter's College, Oxford for letting us film in their beautiful library.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":34,"publishedAt":"2017-10-13T13:33:53.000Z","title":"Protein Folding and Particle Accelerators: A New Solution","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uSErKi_HWg8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uSErKi_HWg8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uSErKi_HWg8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uSErKi_HWg8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/uSErKi_HWg8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"uSErKi_HWg8"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"uSErKi_HWg8","videoPublishedAt":"2016-09-01T08:30:59.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/fO7Gwksucx2ioiuP3kwhZaA_g3g\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC40QTA3NTU2RkM1QzlCMzYx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"In particle accelerators, beams of particles are focused and fired forward at almost the speed of light. But how are those particles controlled? With the help of two visual demonstrations, Suzie Sheehy explains.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nWatch Suzie's lecture on her research and the future of particle accelerators: https:\/\/youtu.be\/jLmciZdh5j4\nAnd watch our film on how to power a particle accelerator: https:\/\/youtu.be\/-F9EqYLQKYI\n\nKeeping a handle on particles is key to the huge range of applications particle accelerators have. The machines accelerate beams of particles using electric and magnetic fields. Suzie uses a \u2018Paul trap\u2019 to show how rapidly oscillating currents are used to keep particles on track. A ball on the saddle apparatus is kept in the centre by the rising sides. But that only controls the ball in one direction, meaning it can drop off. Magnetic or electric fields are similar, and can only direct particles in one plane at a time. When the kit begins to spin, though, the alternating position of the rising sides means the ball is contained in the center. This has the same effect that quadrupole magnets in an accelerator have, constantly alternating gradients to keep particles in line.\n\nUsing a more sophisticated setup, a quadrupole linear Paul trap, pollen grains can be held in place in a beam just as particles in an accelerator would be. Oscillating fields established across rods on opposite corners of the system keep the pollen particles trapped. Without the rapidly changing fields, the particles would just shoot off in one direction; it\u2019s the changes that keep them from escaping in one or the other direction.\n\nThese simple analogies show how particle accelerators guide particles into focused beams, to be harnessed for a huge range of applications.\n\nThis video is supported by the Science and Technology Facilities Council.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":35,"publishedAt":"2017-10-13T13:45:39.000Z","title":"How To Trap Particles in a Particle Accelerator","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LR_aNOcnH0Q\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"LR_aNOcnH0Q"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"LR_aNOcnH0Q","videoPublishedAt":"2016-08-25T08:13:44.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/emfcbfQxg6vUsW98aOXoTL5FxIo\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC5BRjJDODk5REM0NjkzMUIy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"How do you power a particle accelerator firing beams of protons 50 times a second into a heavy metal target?

At that speed, the humble carrot can inflict serious damage on anything that gets in its way. And yet that\u2019s just a fraction of the speed of objects in orbit around the Earth. For example, the International Space Station travels 100 times faster, at about 8 km per second. \n\nTo understand why moving at such high speeds makes collisions so deadly, we have to consider what matter really is. Andy suggests that matter as we\u2019re familiar with it is really determined by the chemical bonds that holds it together, rather than the atoms and molecules themselves. At extreme speeds, collisions have so much kinetic energy that all of an object\u2019s chemical bonds are likely to be broken, in effect resulting in a high-energy explosion as unbound atoms hurtle out in all directions.\n\nSo how do spacecraft protect themselves from these superfast threats?

An innovative research project uses speech analysis to spot hints of underlying anxieties.\nDay 19 of our advent calendar, A Place Called Space http:\/\/rigb.org\/advent\n\nBeing an astronaut is a stressful job. You face the constant threat of annihilation, and know that a huge team and expensive mission rely on you doing your job well. \n\nBut astronauts aren\u2019t always the best at identifying, or admitting, when they\u2019re stressed or overwhelmed. Sarita Robinson, a psychologist from the University of Central Lancaster, says that while we\u2019re increasingly comfortable with the intense physiological conditions of space travel, our understanding of the psychological impacts still leaves something to be desired. Mark Huckvale and a team at University College London ran a research project that investigated whether subtle variations in speech patterns of astronauts taking part in the Mars 500 experiment might reveal anxieties that the astronauts\u2019 words were hiding.\n\nCould subtle cues in the way an astronaut speaks let mission control know when they\u2019re starting to feel the strain?\n\n\u2018A Place Called Space\u2019 is the 2015 Royal Institution advent calendar.

Armed with a kettle, some forks, and a healthily salted steak, Andy experiments. Needless to say, don\u2019t try this, or any of these experiments, at home. As the electricity is forced through the steak, electrons try to flow through and interact with all the atoms and molecules of the meat. The steak doesn\u2019t conduct electricity very well, so the electrons have to be pushed very hard and transfer energy to the meat, in a process called joule heating. \n\nNot satisfied with that, Andy and Greg cracked out the parabolas. Parabolas focus all the incoming beams into one central focus, meaning that energy normally spread across a wide area can be harnessed to one spot of intensity. Intense enough, in fact, to singe a steak to perfection. \n\nWe\u2019ve soared through the science of whoosh bottle rockets before (click here to watch that film: https:\/\/youtu.be\/_pR6w7G06tw) \u2013 could they provide the perfect platform for rapid prawn cooking? Perhaps, but there\u2019s a projectile prawn issue to resolve first.\n\nGreg and Andy also investigated the best way to cook a steak using chemistry.

Kate tackles sudden changes in hormones and light intensity in an attempt to explain why winter makes you SAD. \nSubscribe for more from Kate: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly natural for people to unwind and perk up at the beginning of summer as the appearance of the sun marks the end of a dark and gloomy winter. However for some people changing seasons can have such significant impacts on their mood that they are said to be suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder, otherwise known as SAD. \n\nSAD involves the effects of depression either developing or worsening during the wintertime and it is believed to be in part stimulated by the change in light intensity as the number of daylight hours decreases in the colder months.  This is due to the change in the environment causing an imbalance in the hormones that control your mood.  Different people react differently to this change, hence the small amount of people that suffer from SAD.\n\nIt\u2019s this could be partly due to our ancestors hibernating in winter months. However, not to worry; if the effects of the disorder are really too much, just move to Arizona, the sunniest place in the world. \n\nThis film is part of our series that provides the blueprint for a scientifically perfect summer.

Why does it make us laugh? It\u2019s hard to pin down a scientific definition \u2013 or explanation \u2013 of tickling. It\u2019s a complex phenomenon, involving a range of sensory and neurological elements, which means it\u2019s hard to identify why it evolved. Is it socially significant? Or an alarm system, warning us of things crawling on our skin?\n\nWhy can\u2019t you tickle yourself? Dr Emily Grossman explains how your brain anticipates the movement of your hands, and suppresses the tickle response. Can you use the fact that you can't tickle yourself to stop other people being able to tickle you?\n\nDr Emily Grossman, science presenter and educator www.emilygrossman.co.uk @DrEmilyGrossman\n\nDr. Emily Grossman is an expert in molecular biology and genetics, with a Triple First in Natural Sciences from Queens' College Cambridge and a PhD in cancer research.

They explore how doing different things to cream results in different products, learning about how physical actions can affect the consistency of a substance. To make butter, they shake a jar of double cream that has been left out overnight. As they shake, they feel a change in consistency, and are soon left with a solid lump of butter and a little buttermilk. Whipped cream is made by simply whisking cold cream until it becomes foamy.\n\nThe girls learn that milk and cream are composed mainly of water and fat. The shaking and whisking causes fat globules to interact with each other. When making butter, the fat molecules break free from their globules, and join together to form butter. Whisking adds air to cream, breaking apart the fat globules. It forms protective bubbles around tiny pockets of air and changes the consistency of the cream. \n\nThis series of ExpeRimental is supported by the Royal Society of Chemistry.\n\nThis is the second of three special ExpeRimental films released in British Science Week.\n\nExpeRimental, brought to you by the Royal Institution of Great Britain, is a series of free short films that make it fun, easy and cheap to do science at home with children aged 4 to 10.

For millennia, a simple cut or cough could kill. With the development of antibiotics, it seemed we would reign supreme.\n\nBut now the bacteria are again gaining ground.\n\nWith antibiotic resistance on the rise, and the development of new drugs having stagnated for decades, we humans might be in a lot of trouble very soon. Why are bacteria so insidious, what tricks do they employ to get the upper hand, and what can we do to stop them? Join Dr Jenny Rohn to explore these questions.\n\nDr Jenny Rohn received a BA in Biology from Oberlin College, Ohio, where she developed an interest in viruses and cancer before moving to the University of Washington for her PhD research into the evolution of feline leukaemia virus.\n\nAfter working as a researcher at Cancer Research UK and working in the biotechology industry in The Netherlands, Jenny gained a Wellcome Trust fellowship to study cell shape and architecture at University College London.

Watch the flakes shoot across the water at the touch of a finger. They experiment with different liquids, investigating how substances around the house affect the surface of water. The dramatic effect you see is because the soap weakens the pull that water molecules have on each other. As a result, as the soap spreads over the surface of the water, the water is able to pull away, taking the oregano or pepper with it.\n\nThis amazing trick can be used to make a great activity. Cut a boat shape out of a drinks carton, with a little space at the back (for the \u2018engine\u2019). When you add a drop of soap in the hole, it pushes water out, backwards. The water moving out the back of the boat pushes it forward, just as hot gases coming out of the bottom of a rocket push it upwards.\n\nDownload our boat templates and info sheet and race some boats yourself.

As the oxygen supply is consumed, carbon particles start to be released, which cause the yellow flame. The pulses of flame that appear in the bottle towards the end of the reaction are probably created as fresh oxygen is drawn in from the top, and mixes with the remaining fuel. Watch amazing slow motion footage of the explosion.\n\nThis beautiful experiment is also a great example of a simple rocket; a device for creating force by pushing the products of fuel combustion in one direction. Andy takes to the lecture theatre to investigate whether the force is enough to push him on a swing. He tries to determine how much force is being generated, and experiments with different fuels.

Over six centuries from 600 BC a group of revolutionary thinkers -- from Thales, Pythagoras, Democritus and Aristotle to Euclid, Archimedes and Hypatia of Alexandria -- formalised the rules and language of modern mathematics. \n\nFor Greek thinkers, maths wasn't simply a means of calculating amounts but a way of testing reality and understanding the true nature of the world around them. Indeed, Pythagoras is believed to have coined both the words \"philosophy\" (\"love of wisdom\") and \"mathematics\" (\"that which is learned\"). In turn, Euclid came to be known as the \"father of geometry\". \n\nAt the heart of this new understanding, was the concept of \"the proof\", developed by Euclid in what is commonly regarded as the most important and successful mathematical textbook of all time -- the \"Stoicheion\" or \"Elements\". Built upon the axiomatic method, mathematical proofs were a way of testing assumptions by building up a mathematical argument using self-evident or assumed statements (or, \"axioms\"). \n\nIt is this methodology that formed the foundational language and logic of modern mathematics throughout the world.  Indeed, Euclid's Elements was widely used as the seminal maths textbook right up until the start of the twentieth century. \n\nMany thanks to James Grime for his expert help on the script and recording the voice-over.

We typically inherit 23 pairs of chromosomes from our parents, but when mistakes occur in the process of meiosis (the formation of sperm and egg cells) some sex cells can end up with two copies of the same chromosome. The chromosome that this usually occurs with is chromosome 21. When that sex cell then fuses with another to form an embryo, that embryo inherits 3 copies of chromosome 21 (one from one parent, and two from another) meaning that it has 47 chromosomes instead of 46. As chromosome 21 is one of the shortest chromosomes the embryo can survive this duplication, but the result is a condition called Down's Syndrome, which causes developmental and physical disabilities.

Understanding more about the process by which blood clots form not only helps us to intervene in this process for medical benefits, but also gives an insight into the nature of several rare but significant diseases which affect bleeding. \n\nOne example of this is a disease called Von Willebrand, related to a gene of the same name on chromosome 12, where the absence of a specific biomolecule leads to problems with prolonged bleeding.

DNA often gets damaged by everyday processes within our bodies, but also from external factors such as UV radiation or tobacco smoke. Luckily, our bodies are well equipped to fix this damage thanks, in part, to the BRCA2 gene, found on chromosome 13.\n\nBRCA2 encodes for a large protein which carries out repair work on damaged DNA. It's no surprise then that if the BRCA2 is faulty, or missing, our cells can't repair themselves properly. As a result, the damaged DNA builds up and this can lead to cancer.\n\nIn turns out, however, that faults on BRCA2 aren't necessarily such an advantage to cancer cells. As their BRCA2 gene is faulty, the only remaining \"tool\" in a cancer cell's molecular repair kit is another gene known as PARP. Dr Kat Arney from Cancer Research UK explains how by using drugs to block PARP function, scientists are hoping to prevent cancer cells from repairing themselves, causing them to die off.

Usually LDLs are removed from our bloodstream by LDL receptors -- proteins which are coded for by a gene on chromosome 19. \n\nUsing the London underground as an analogy, Dr Simon Watt explains how a fault on this gene results in a build up of cholesterol, causing congestion in our arteries and leading to potentially fatal cardiovascular disease. If we understand more about these genes, however, and can identify those with genetically high cholesterol there are simple precautions we can take to avoid trouble.\n\nWith thanks to BBSRC: http:\/\/bbsrc.ac.uk\/\n\nDon't miss the 2013 CHRISTMAS LECTURES on BBC Four and BBC iPlayer: http:\/\/rigb.org\/christmas-lectures\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":106,"publishedAt":"2017-10-30T14:33:15.000Z","title":"Chromosome 19 - Keeping things moving","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/omcooupQ-u0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/omcooupQ-u0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/omcooupQ-u0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"omcooupQ-u0"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"omcooupQ-u0","videoPublishedAt":"2013-12-19T07:38:47.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Qbva9yZ_7_5ej8exDziQid9zOD8\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC44NjIxNjc5OUQwQkJBODQ5","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"EXPLORE THE RI ADVENT CALENDAR: http:\/\/rigb.org.uk\/advent \n\nOf all our chromosomes, chromosome 18 is the least dense in terms of genes, with barely any of its rather paltry 76 million base pairs encoding actual genes.

It turns out, however, that we still don't fully understand how these genetic sequences code for all that we see around us, and that there is a whole extra layer of information to our genetic code called \"epigenetics\". \n\nEpigenetic markers on our DNA influence the way in which genes are \"read\", rather like punctuation in a sentence, determining whether a particular gene will be expressed or not. We usually have two \"switched on\" copies of each gene (one from each parent), but this is not always the case. Fatima Santos, from The Babraham Institute explains how Chromosome 11 has helped us to understand how epigenetic markers can result in certain DNA sequences being expressed in one cell and not in another.

Inspired by the forthcoming 'Life Fantastic' CHRISTMAS LECTURES with Dr Alison Woollard, we'll release a different video each day between 1 December and Christmas Eve. The short films will explore the 23 pairs of human chromosomes and the mitochondrial DNA that make up the building blocks of human life.\n\nHighlights include geneticist Dr Adam Rutherford exploring what 'junk' DNA is, a light-hearted look at male baldness with former Christmas lecturer Mark Miodownik, and a visit to Alison's lab at the University of Oxford to learn more about the genetic control of ageing. We'll explain Nobel Prize winning science, take a trip to the zoo and delve into the mysteries of ginger hair.\n\nThe series will also raise awareness of several rare and not-so-rare genetic disorders such as Alkaptonuria (AKU) as well as other more well known diseases with a hereditary link including breast cancer. Through interviews with experts and personal stories we'll reveal the genetic secrets behind these conditions and highlight the latest cutting-edge research to help prevent, treat and manage them.\n\nWith thanks to BBSRC: http:\/\/bbsrc.ac.uk\/\n\nDon't miss the 2013 CHRISTMAS LECTURES on BBC Four and BBC iPlayer: http:\/\/rigb.org\/christmas-lectures\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":119,"publishedAt":"2017-10-30T15:22:45.000Z","title":"Chromosome Trailer - Ri Advent Calendar 2013","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DyXBCjnry4s\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DyXBCjnry4s\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DyXBCjnry4s\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DyXBCjnry4s\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"DyXBCjnry4s"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"DyXBCjnry4s","videoPublishedAt":"2013-11-29T12:14:11.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/HssErwqPIB1fm038a_BdZfMqwHM\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC41MzJFNEYxODEyNzA0QUUx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"As the field of crystallography celebrates its centenary year we look back at how it all began -- with a father and son team and a humble salt crystal. \n\nWith the help of archive footage and historic objects from the Ri, Patience Thomson, daughter of William Lawrence Bragg, presents an intimate portrait of her father. From his detailed artworks to his love of detective stories and puzzles, Patience reveals how Lawrence's unique character and analytical mindset led to numerous scientific breakthroughs. \n\nPlus, find out how he reacted to receiving news of his Nobel Prize while serving on the front during WW1 at the age of 25 and discover how the Braggs applied their scientific knowledge to aid the war effort.  \n\nProfessor Stephen Curry is also on hand to demonstrate just how important the Braggs' discovery was and how the field of x-ray crystallography has revealed the structure of hundreds of different molecules, from enzymes and proteins to entire viruses.

Made up of doctors and scientists from University College London, University of Southampton and Duke University, the project also involved a group of healthy volunteers willing to be subjected to a series of intensive physical tests. \n\nThe team were braving the extreme conditions to investigate the underlying physiological reasons why some people can cope better with low oxygen conditions than others. Since the first expedition in 2007, the project is focusing not only on the amount of oxygen you can get into your system, but on how well you can deliver that oxygen to where it's needed and how efficiently your body then uses that oxygen.\n\nLying at 5,364 metres, Everest base camp contains around half the amount of oxygen compared to sea level, providing the perfect conditions for testing and research. In this case, the \"lab\" involves two insulated tents full of the latest medical technology, including two exercise bikes with full gas analysis systems, centrifuges and blood sampling kits -- all of which had to be brought from Lukla airport (a ten day trek). \n\nMany of the team work in Intensive Care Units and are interested in examining what happens to the body when there is not enough oxygen reaching their vital organs. Whether through lung failure, a heart attack or a stroke, 90% of intensive care patients suffer from the effects of a shortage of oxygen. The knowledge gained in the extreme conditions at Everest could dramatically increase the chances of patients back home.\n\nThe film was funded by the Wellcome Trust.\n\nExplore the Xtreme Everest website\nhttp:\/\/www.xtreme-everest.co.uk\/\n\nRead Greg Foot's Guardian blog post on the project. http:\/\/www.guardian.co.uk\/science\/blog\/2013\/may\/29\/everest-breathtaking-medical-research\n\nVisit Daredevil Labs: Everest to find out where to see Greg's live show in schools and at science festivals throughout the year. \nhttp:\/\/www.gregfoot.com\/daredevil-labs-everest\/\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":125,"publishedAt":"2017-10-30T16:17:27.000Z","title":"Xtreme Everest - The World's Highest Research Lab","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tovsOiSvZ_c\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tovsOiSvZ_c\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tovsOiSvZ_c\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tovsOiSvZ_c\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tovsOiSvZ_c\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"tovsOiSvZ_c"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"tovsOiSvZ_c","videoPublishedAt":"2013-05-29T08:57:13.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/IJq_8WGjr78LhJcjE9hKsYF5xOU\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC44M0Q5MzQ0QTcwQzFDMjc5","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Materials scientist and Christmas Lecturer Mark Miodownik demonstrates some of the weird properties of ferrofluid.

We joined Dr Peter Wothers on the roof of the Ri building in London to show exactly why.\n\nAbove the famous Lecture Theatre, the team set up a clear protective shield around a beaker filled with 150ml of oil. This was heated over a Bunsen until a small fire was burning. Wearing a fire protective suit, Dr Wothers then poured water from a small cup directly onto the fire.\n\nThe reaction is so violent because water and oil don't mix. When the water is poured into the beaker of burning oil it sinks to the bottom and, due to the intense heat, vaporizes into steam almost instantaneously. With this phase change from a liquid to a gaseous state the water expands by up to 1700 times and forces the fire above it upwards.

However, his attempt to disassociate fluorine from molten lead fluoride (PbF2) -- itself a very dangerous substance -- was never successful due to the extreme reactivity of Fluorine. On release it reacted almost immediately with the oxygen in the air and could not be isolated. \n\nThe problem was only solved around fifty years later by the French Chemist Henri Mossain in 1886, a feat for which he received the Nobel Prize.  \n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":131,"publishedAt":"2017-10-30T16:34:55.000Z","title":"Michael Faraday's Failure with Fluorine","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ihOD0F8Ukbc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ihOD0F8Ukbc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ihOD0F8Ukbc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ihOD0F8Ukbc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"ihOD0F8Ukbc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"ihOD0F8Ukbc","videoPublishedAt":"2013-03-19T14:29:47.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/6hwXvkTxk0gQTOiXsyVVpYKUFZU\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC40MzEwNkU4RUE0MjhBRjg4","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Professor Neil Shubin talks about the discovery of Tiktaalik and one of the greatest evolutionary events in Earth's history: when the very first fish ventured out onto land.\n\nWidely known as the \"fishapod\", Tiktaalik roseae is a 375 million year old fossil fish discovered by a team of six palaeontologists in the Canadian Arctic in 2004. \n\nTiktaalik looks like a cross between the primitive fish it lived amongst and the first four-legged animals, a group called \"tetrapods\". Derived from \"tetra-\", meaning four, and \"-pod\", meaning foot, all animals that descended from these pioneer amphibians, including us, can be called tetrapods. \n\nTiktaalik lived about 12 million years before the first tetrapods (which are approximately 363 million years old). With the earliest appearance in the fossil record of tetrapod features in a fish, the discovery has become a key piece of evidence in the transition from life in water to life on land.\n\nWatch more

These images are then feed into a bespoke computer programme to map the true position of the tether against the backdrop of a cloudy sky.\n\nWith a bit of tweaking and data processing (the rarely seen \"boring bit\" of much modern research) Hilary is able to accurately model the position of her kite tether -- a tool that will prove vital in her ongoing research.\n\nThis film is part of a project funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering to develop the on camera communication skills of engineers across the UK.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":140,"publishedAt":"2017-10-31T15:07:31.000Z","title":"Scanning the Sky with Computer Code","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXL_oiHKNm0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXL_oiHKNm0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXL_oiHKNm0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXL_oiHKNm0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/CXL_oiHKNm0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"CXL_oiHKNm0"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"CXL_oiHKNm0","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-22T10:29:05.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/c1tZASeu2SVHnZz2lcYmYReymAg\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC4wQjA4QkVEQ0RFREIzMjFC","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Professor Martyn Pavier explores steam trains, bridges and potential catastrophe.\n\nBy testing how cyclical loading patterns differ from static ones he explains how the effect is a crucial consideration when choosing materials for use in load-bearing structures like railway bridges.\n\nTo help demonstrate this continuing importance of materials testing in modern engineering Professor Pavier heads to the station, hops on a lop-sided bicycle and explores the history of the bridge-collapse in the age of steam.  \n\nThis film is part of a project funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering to develop the on camera  communication skills of engineers across the UK.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":141,"publishedAt":"2017-10-31T15:11:12.000Z","title":"Steam trains, bridges and potential catastrophe","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-7d0Z9yhKSg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-7d0Z9yhKSg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-7d0Z9yhKSg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-7d0Z9yhKSg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-7d0Z9yhKSg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"-7d0Z9yhKSg"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"-7d0Z9yhKSg","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-11T15:18:16.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/tOzUvy6U0CLnL7Z1Q57_Y_hmbW8\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC4wNjIzRDA1OTQ2M0UyODEw","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Serious accidents and deaths on the roads of Britain have been greatly reduced over the last 20 years -- not because we are safer drivers but because of better safety engineering.\n\nSeat belts, airbags and crumple zones have all contributed to this decline.

Under increased pressure the aorta always ruptures in the same place but no one knows exactly why.  \n\nLike any good scientists or research engineer Donal is keen to test a particular hypothesis using real world simulations to discover the cause of aortic ruptures.\n\nCan he find the answer or will his hypothesis be disproved? \n\nThis film is part of a project funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering to develop the on camera  communication skills of engineers across the UK.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":142,"publishedAt":"2017-10-31T15:13:41.000Z","title":"Why does Aortic Rupture cause so many deaths?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-GcP2YTJkQ0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-GcP2YTJkQ0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-GcP2YTJkQ0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-GcP2YTJkQ0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"-GcP2YTJkQ0"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"-GcP2YTJkQ0","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-05T15:09:15.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/hDatqYzy1gkANKqOJK-wg-eamBc\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC5EQTdFNDU3M0Y3MTM1QjlG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Cycling is undoubtedly good for you but, as Donal McNally is all too aware, accidents happen. A Professor of Bioengineering at Nottingham University his work involves simulating accidents to analyse the forces and stress acting on the human skeleton.\n\nCycling home in late 2010 he was involved in the \"ultimate ironic accident\". Hit from behind by a car he suffered a broken neck, a lower back fracture and three cracked ribs, but was saved by his cycling helmet.\n\nAs Donal himself says, this outcome was determined not by chance, but by the laws of physics.\n\nIn this short film, he explores the cycle helmet technology used to prevent injuries and fatalities on the road -- including his own -- and demonstrates how the extra padding around your head dissipate the energy of the impact.\n\nIn the absence of volunteers for randomised controlled trials involving real accidents, Donal performs tests using computer simulations re-running the same accident and conditions with or without different types of helmet. Without a memory of his own near-fatal accident he can recreate the collision with a computer simulation to finally discover why he survived. \n\nThis film is part of a project funded by the Royal Academy of Engineering to develop the on camera  communication skills of engineers across the UK.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":143,"publishedAt":"2017-10-31T15:16:33.000Z","title":"Preventing cycling injury with physics","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SgH5ZwZ1OdI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SgH5ZwZ1OdI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/SgH5ZwZ1OdI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"SgH5ZwZ1OdI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"SgH5ZwZ1OdI","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-05T14:27:46.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/EE2egLMNU759OZew6-1SOKzSimc\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC4xRjE1NzQ4MjRCMUNFRDdB","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Most Ph.D.s focus on niche topics in a very specific field (see here) and Hilary Costello's research project is no different. Her ongoing Phd looks into the properties of aerodynamic stability of very long tethers for very high balloons or vew deep offshore oil and gas platforms underwater. \n\nUnderstanding tether dynamics is extremely complex with numerous factors effecting the behaviour of a cable - from the shape and aerodynamics of the tether to the elasticity, bending and torsion of the materials used not to mention the chaging wind speed and temperature at heights of up to 20km. \n\nTesting the cable dynamics of new tether designs in the real-world is a crucial part of the research process and by modelling and testing cables in isolated sections, it is possible to better understand and model how these may operate together in a larger system.\n\nWith limited access to mile-high balloons, Hilary can often be found in the green pastures of Cambridge University flying kites!

The photo -- which revealed the structure of DNA -- was later used by James D. Watson and Francis Crick as the basis for their famous model of the double helix. \n\nBy shining a laser through different configurations of wire, Andy is able to change the resulting diffraction pattern. Theoretically, he could then work backwards from each pattern to deduce the original position of each wire. \n\nIt is this idea that forms the basis of X-ray crystallography, using x-rays instead of laser light, and atoms instead of wires. X-ray crystallography allowed Rosalind Franklin to determine the 3D structure of DNA by analysing the X-ray diffraction patterns of crystals made up of the molecule. \n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":159,"publishedAt":"2017-11-01T12:31:47.000Z","title":"Tales from the Prep Room: Laser Diffraction","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pRZ7cSP1zMM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pRZ7cSP1zMM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pRZ7cSP1zMM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pRZ7cSP1zMM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/pRZ7cSP1zMM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"pRZ7cSP1zMM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"pRZ7cSP1zMM","videoPublishedAt":"2011-12-16T12:48:35.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/5F5F9hZvOitN_6L6Ly7IOwn7xeg\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC41RjU0OTVCQThDNUUwQzBD","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Held in September 2011, the Unconference aimed to get young people to think seriously and creatively about complex issues facing their generation - from science in the media and careers to the future of science education and the impending global environmental crisis.  \n\nHighlights included challenging addresses by environmentalist Hugh Montgomery, science publicist Sallie Robins, science teacher Alom Shaha, and space scientist Maggie Aderin-Pocock. \n\nAfter workshops and break-out sessions throughout the Ri Building, the delegates revealed their recommendations to policy makers including a beef tax and harder science GCSEs.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":160,"publishedAt":"2017-11-01T12:53:17.000Z","title":"The Ri Unconference 2011 - Highlights","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7Ir8Bx8eDOU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7Ir8Bx8eDOU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7Ir8Bx8eDOU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7Ir8Bx8eDOU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/7Ir8Bx8eDOU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"7Ir8Bx8eDOU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"7Ir8Bx8eDOU","videoPublishedAt":"2011-12-08T10:02:06.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/eb4UsAlZvfFAprE5lkITswO-k3E\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC5BRjY4NjdBRjA5RTdCMUMx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"John Pendry of Imperial College London explains how the wing structure of the Blue Adonis butterfly inspired and informed his cutting-edge research into 'metamaterials'.\n\nAs the saying goes: \"the caterpillar does all the work but the butterfly gets all the publicity.\"* In this case, however, the publicity may be well deserved.\n\nOrganisms such as the Blue Adonis possess unique microstructures on their wing surface which diffract blue light and lend them their iridescent blue appearance. In a similar way, metamaterials are being built from modified microstructures and components smaller than the wavelength of the light. By bending light around objects they are being used in the development of new materials including the world's first invisibility cloak.\n\nSimilar work is being carried out in optical computing by Brigham Young University (BYU) with the natural photonic crystals inside the scales of Brazilian beetles. Our intern Ed also unearthed a great video from the Lawrence Hall of Science (University of California) zooming in the wing of a Blue Morpho butterfly -- from 10 centimeters to 200 nanometers.\n\n*Attributed to George Carlin (American stand-up Comedian, Actor and Author)\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":161,"publishedAt":"2017-11-01T12:57:37.000Z","title":"From Butterfly Wings to Metamaterials","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YO5S77tfDZ0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YO5S77tfDZ0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YO5S77tfDZ0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YO5S77tfDZ0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/YO5S77tfDZ0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"YO5S77tfDZ0"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"YO5S77tfDZ0","videoPublishedAt":"2011-12-07T16:49:16.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/AeE2kruLRM5akA9ne6gwC6G_bfg\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC5DMkM0MjQ3OTgwQzBCMEZB","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"With the help of a specialist doctor and an opera singer, Sophie Scott investigates how the different parts of the voice box come together to create the human voice.\nWatch the full lecture here: https:\/\/youtu.be\/MbvoQoOn2YE\nLink to the site the monkey pointed out: http:\/\/www.bbc.co.uk\/ri\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":162,"publishedAt":"2018-02-09T15:05:46.000Z","title":"Laryngoscopy of an Opera Singer - 2017 CHRISTMAS LECTURES","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-1Fv7IPmJo4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-1Fv7IPmJo4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-1Fv7IPmJo4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-1Fv7IPmJo4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/-1Fv7IPmJo4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"-1Fv7IPmJo4"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"-1Fv7IPmJo4","videoPublishedAt":"2018-02-09T15:05:33.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/MVW6rl5JvYdMmrTZSELpzq9fgCM\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeVB4a3RJR1JJZnYzZnlJVVoxbUpCSC45QzM0OUZCRDUyMTgwREVG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"How are smoke rings formed? Natasha heads to the prep room to test out air cannons.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nA toroidal vortex ring is formed when a fast moving fluid moves through a relatively still other or different fluid. For example, smoke rings blown through air, or bubble rings in water.\n\nIn our cannon example, to start with, the smoke is basically a fast moving ball. As it emerges through the opening, the smoke outside of the ball is being slowed down because of the friction between it and the edges of the hole. Once it leaves the cannon, there is friction at the interface between the smoke and the air in the room. The smoke in the centre of the ball is moving faster than the smoke around the edges, so the smoke on the edges starts to curl around and form a mushroom cloud. As the smoke reaches the back of the cloud, it\u2019s drawn into the faster moving current of air in the centre. It\u2019s this flow pattern that eventually causes the ring to form.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyPxktIGRIfv3fyIUZ1mJBH","position":163,"publishedAt":"2018-03-14T17:23:36.000Z","title":"The Science of Vortex Rings","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yjgACB7urOo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yjgACB7urOo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yjgACB7urOo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yjgACB7urOo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yjgACB7urOo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"yjgACB7urOo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"yjgACB7urOo","videoPublishedAt":"2018-03-14T17:25:28.000Z"}}]}
