Almost 40 years later, we\u2019ve made great progress and large strides further into space, but in some ways have barely got our feet wet. The words Carl Sagan concluded his Lectures on \u2018The planets\u2019 with are as meaningful now as there were then. \n\nAs we look to send people to Mars and then beyond, are we finally realising Sagan\u2019s vision? \n\nThis clip from the 1977 CHRISTMAS LECTURES was animated by the Ri animator-in-residence Andrew Khosravani.\n\n\u2018A Place Called Space\u2019 is the 2015 Royal Institution advent calendar.

Helen Czerski tells the story of how the maps of one of history\u2019s finest cartographers shifted our view of the planet.\nSubscribe for new science videos each week: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nIn the early 20th century, Alfred Wegener proposed a revolutionary idea: that the Earth\u2019s continents were once joined together, and had gradually moved apart. The idea contradicted almost everything scientists thought at the time, and it took the detailed work of a brilliant cartographer to prove him right.\n\nConventional ideas held that the ocean floors were flat, featureless planes. As expeditions started to go around the world collecting ocean depth measurements, Marie Tharp \u2013 not allowed to join the expeditions herself \u2013 processed the data and began to craft detailed, revealing maps of the hidden ocean depths. \n\nShe discovered that the ocean floor was in fact a complex assortment of peaks and troughs. In particular, her profiles revealed stark rift valleys, which supported Wegener\u2019s controversial ideas. Even then, it took a long time to convince the scientific community that her findings were correct. Eventually, however, she was proved right, and Marie Tharp took her rightful place as one of history\u2019s finest cartographers. \n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZxfamuO9tJnUeQ2qi-HOWPS","position":3,"publishedAt":"2017-12-05T12:55:39.000Z","title":"Marie Tharp: Uncovering the Secrets of the Ocean Floor - with Helen Czerski","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/TgfYjS0OTWw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"TgfYjS0OTWw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"TgfYjS0OTWw","videoPublishedAt":"2016-11-16T09:16:35.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/V_jsyWvlfy75fXItpSttSrU70mg\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeGZhbXVPOXRKblVlUTJxaS1IT1dQUy4wOTA3OTZBNzVEMTUzOTMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"A two-minute animated adventure to Ancient Greece and back again - voiced by Numberphile's James Grime!  \n\nOften called the \"birthplace of civilisation\", Ancient Greece heralded numerous advances in philosophy, science, sport and also mathematics. Over six centuries from 600 BC a group of revolutionary thinkers -- from Thales, Pythagoras, Democritus and Aristotle to Euclid, Archimedes and Hypatia of Alexandria -- formalised the rules and language of modern mathematics. \n\nFor Greek thinkers, maths wasn't simply a means of calculating amounts but a way of testing reality and understanding the true nature of the world around them. Indeed, Pythagoras is believed to have coined both the words \"philosophy\" (\"love of wisdom\") and \"mathematics\" (\"that which is learned\"). In turn, Euclid came to be known as the \"father of geometry\". \n\nAt the heart of this new understanding, was the concept of \"the proof\", developed by Euclid in what is commonly regarded as the most important and successful mathematical textbook of all time -- the \"Stoicheion\" or \"Elements\". Built upon the axiomatic method, mathematical proofs were a way of testing assumptions by building up a mathematical argument using self-evident or assumed statements (or, \"axioms\"). \n\nIt is this methodology that formed the foundational language and logic of modern mathematics throughout the world.  Indeed, Euclid's Elements was widely used as the seminal maths textbook right up until the start of the twentieth century. \n\nMany thanks to James Grime for his expert help on the script and recording the voice-over.
