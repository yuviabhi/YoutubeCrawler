By playing a memory game, trying to remember 10 random objects in different ways, they explore how our brains work. Do some techniques work better for memorising things than others? Sam comes up with his own ideas of how to remember the objects, and finally creates a silly story to help cement the list in his mind.\n\nThese sorts of games are a great way to get children thinking like psychologists, and considering how their brains work.\n\nThis series of ExpeRimental is supported by the British Psychological Society. \n\nExpeRimental, brought to you by the Royal Institution of Great Britain, is a series of free short films that make it fun, easy and cheap to do science at home with children aged 4 to 10.

Can you count while someone else says numbers at you? Can you rub your tummy and pat your head at the same time? Can you sing one song while listening to another? These pairs are all similar tasks that 'interfere' with each other, because the same part of the brain is needed to carry both out.\nHowever, try rubbing your head while counting, and it's not so hard, because your brain can tackle each task simultaneously.

This activity is all about understanding a bit more about how these work, and why our brains perceive what is actually a series of still images as flowing motion.\n\nBy making a thaumatrope, you can learn about 'persistence of vision', as two images pass by your eyes so quickly that you are still processing one when you see the next, so your brain merges the two together to see a complete image.\n\nA phenakistoscope works just like classic animation and movies.

Here are five simple ways to get the most out of the activities with your kids.\nWe have 30 fun, free experiments to try: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/families\/experimental\n\nOur top 5 tips:\n1 - Don't worry if you don't know the science! When doing our activities for kids ages 4-10, It's not about facts and figures, it's about asking questions, investigating the world, and thinking.\n2 - Play, look, ask. This is a great structure to keep in mind when doing an experiment. Have fun, look closely, and question everything you see.\n3 - Ask the right questions. Asking questions is the most important thing about doing these activities, and asking the right ones can help your child get the most out of them. Rather than simple 'yes\/no' questions, try to encourage them to think for themselves. Instead of 'do you think this will happen', try 'what do you think will happen'. It's a subtle difference, but has a big impact.\n4 - Go off script! We've provided a set of instructions, but don't feel you need to stick to them. Try other things, do it your own way, and importantly, let the kids try out any ideas of their own.\n5 - Don't worry if it doesn't work! Science experiments, whether in a kitchen or a laboratory, often don't quite work. Don't worry! Use that as part of the investigation. Get the kids thinking about why it didn't work? What could you change to improve it? The experiments aren't about the final results, they're about the process.\n\nThis series of ExpeRimental is supported by the British Psychological Society: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/about\/news\/spring-2017\/bps-experimental\n\nTry all of our ExpeRiments here, let us know how you get on! http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/families\/experimental\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZzzdyGOR0xviITACtyj232V","position":9,"publishedAt":"2017-07-05T08:54:45.000Z","title":"Science Experiments For Kids - Top 5 Tips!","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xLmYEuEhYzU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"xLmYEuEhYzU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"xLmYEuEhYzU","videoPublishedAt":"2017-07-06T13:31:22.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/M6SS_cwHtnttqgQb_AdsoO3F4Hw\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaenpkeUdPUjB4dmlJVEFDdHlqMjMyVi45ODRDNTg0QjA4NkFBNkQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Learn to make splatter pictures and experiment with trying to spot hidden images in random patterns.\nDownload the infosheet here for more instructions: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/families\/experimental\/multitasking-mayhem\n\nOur brains are constantly trying to make sense of the world around us. In this activity you and your kids will look for familiar shapes in random patterns, and learn about how our brains process the things we see.\n\nWe can create simple but beautiful splatter images by dotting paint onto one half of a sheet of paper and folding it over. After opening it up there will be a completely random pattern, yet we as humans have the ability to spot countless familiar features in it.\n\nWe see shapes and objects in the random patterns because our brains are so well designed to spot and remember objects and animals in real life. It\u2019s sort of a short-cut our brains use to quickly process the world, but it can sometimes mean we see things in unexpected places.\n\nThis series of ExpeRimental is supported by the British Psychological Society: https:\/\/beta.bps.org.uk\/\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZzzdyGOR0xviITACtyj232V","position":10,"publishedAt":"2017-07-06T08:50:56.000Z","title":"Seeing Shapes in Inkblots - Psychology For Kids - Experimental #29","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9j-WdPIz2rU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9j-WdPIz2rU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9j-WdPIz2rU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9j-WdPIz2rU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/9j-WdPIz2rU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"9j-WdPIz2rU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"9j-WdPIz2rU","videoPublishedAt":"2017-06-29T14:43:25.000Z"}}]}
