Can you tell the temperature by the frequency of a cricket\u2019s chirps? Do you know what temperature a butterfly has to be to take off? Kate buzzes around the science of summer insects.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nWith summer seems to come a plague of insects. But what is it about summer that brings them buzzing out of their hideaways? Insects are poikilotherms \u2013 their internal temperature can vary hugely depending on the environment. The opposite of humans. As a result, they rely heavily on external conditions to govern their bodily processes like development and growth.\n\nAnd the more you look into insects\u2019 summer-loving lifestyles, the more interesting they become. From butterflies that can only fly once they get warm enough to crickets that tell the temperature better than your local weatherman, insects have unique approach to life. And have you ever wondered what happens when insects get drunk?\n\nThis film is part of our series that provides the blueprint for a scientifically perfect summer.

But what is it? And why is it called \u2018hay fever\u2019? Kate explores the science of allergies, and hunts through the research for a cure.\nSubscribe for more from Kate: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nHow to prevent hay fever? Hay fever isn\u2019t caused by hay, and isn\u2019t really a fever. Allergic rhinitis is the technical name, but what\u2019s it all about? At its centre, hay fever is an inflammation and irritation of the mucus membranes in the nose. Wind-pollinated plants hurl their pollen into the atmosphere, which finds its way into your nose and starts to wreak havoc. Much like other allergic reactions, hay fever is the result of your body fighting off the injected pollen as if it were a disease-causing invader. Antigen presenting cells, T cells and B cells launch into a hyperactive, over enthusiastic frenzy, ultimately causing symptoms that, although crucial when fighting off real infections, are a needless frustration.\n\nIs there a cure? Not yet, but one strand of new research is finding hope in an unlikely source: parasitic worms. The idea is that the worms alter our immune system to avoid being repelled. These alterations just might hold the key to staving off hay fever, and finding summer happiness at last.\n\nThis film is part of our series that provides the blueprint for a scientifically perfect summer.

Or if it\u2019s even a real thing? What causes it? Kate tackles sudden changes in hormones and light intensity in an attempt to explain why winter makes you SAD. \nSubscribe for more from Kate: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly natural for people to unwind and perk up at the beginning of summer as the appearance of the sun marks the end of a dark and gloomy winter. However for some people changing seasons can have such significant impacts on their mood that they are said to be suffering from Seasonal Affective Disorder, otherwise known as SAD. \n\nSAD involves the effects of depression either developing or worsening during the wintertime and it is believed to be in part stimulated by the change in light intensity as the number of daylight hours decreases in the colder months.  This is due to the change in the environment causing an imbalance in the hormones that control your mood.  Different people react differently to this change, hence the small amount of people that suffer from SAD.\n\nIt\u2019s this could be partly due to our ancestors hibernating in winter months. However, not to worry; if the effects of the disorder are really too much, just move to Arizona, the sunniest place in the world. \n\nThis film is part of our series that provides the blueprint for a scientifically perfect summer.

How can some types cause damage to your eyes? And why do astronauts wear glasses made of gold? Kate explains all.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nToo much light can be a bad thing, and our bodies, with their deep set eyes shielded by bushy brows, are already designed to limit the amount that sneaks in. It is thought that the first sunglasses were made from caribou horns with tiny slits in them that restricted the amount of light entering the eye.\n\nSunglass design has come a long way since then. Light from the high energy end of the spectrum can cause damage to the body\u2019s cells, by breaking chemical bonds in the molecules such as DNA. \n\nSo how do sunglasses protect you? Light absorbing particles in the glasses block some of the light, reducing the amount that reaches the eye. Lenses tinted with colour, such as amber or brown , can block out potentially dangerous blue light. Most importantly, sunglasses \u2013 or good sunglasses, at least \u2013 block out UV rays. But if your glasses don\u2019t have 100% UV protection, then they\u2019ll cause damage, as your pupils will dilate to accommodate the darker view the tint is giving, but won\u2019t then protect you from the increased UV rays that will flood into your wide open eyes.\n\nThis film is part of our new series that will provide the blueprint for a scientifically perfect summer.

No, we\u2019re not talking astrology, but something called the seasonal birth effect. But can even that be trusted? Subscribe: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe seasonal birth effect is the idea that the development of certain characteristics is linked to the time of year a person is born. Various studies have linked time of birth to a gaggle of characteristics, from handedness to disease susceptibility. \n\nThe theory goes that environmental differences during winter and summer pregnancies cause physiological changes that impact early development. For example, increased exposure to sunlight during a summer pregnancy may cause an increase in oxidative stress, which in turn could lead to slight tweaks to the internal conditions for the developing baby.\n\nBut do these studies that claim to have found a link between x trait and y season prove that your birthday dictates your development? No. All it means is that in those specific data sets, the researchers managed to find a link. That doesn\u2019t mean it applies universally, and it definitely doesn\u2019t mean the one is necessarily causing the other. You are not defined by your birthday.\n\nThis film is part of our new series that will provide the blueprint for a scientifically perfect summer. From sweating to hay fever, insects to jet lag, Kate Mulcahy will help you hack summer to engineer the perfect season. Taking a different topic each Thursday, the videos will gradually build up an equation for summer perfection; a summer survival guide certified by science.\nSubscribe to keep up each week: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\n\nReferences:\nRiala, K. et al.

Can we cure it? And why is it a big problem for astronauts going to Mars? Kate dives into the science of circadian rhythms, and armed with the facts, sets out to find a cure. \nSubscribe for more science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe term \u2018jet lag\u2019 flew into the dictionary in 1966, courtesy of Horace Sutton. It describes the physiological strain that long distance air travel can put on your body. Internal rhythms, governed by regular molecular processes known as circadian clocks, keep our bodily functions in a consistent 24 hour pattern. Although these rhythms can keep time on their own, they are amenable to external inputs, such as light. When you fly across the world and plunge your body into a new time zone, the rhythms that have over time lined up with your daily life are thrown out of synch.\n\nThe result? Your whole body feels the strain as your clocks try to wind themselves back into the right time. But once you understand how changes in light levels can trigger the internal processes at the root of jet lag, you can try this simple trick to try to stave it off. \n\nThis film is part of our new series that will provide the blueprint for a scientifically perfect summer.

Can we stop it? Kate swims through the science of sweating and shows you how to harness your body\u2019s other cooling mechanisms to keep your temperature down this summer without building up a sweat. Subscribe: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nHumans are endothermic, and try to keep their body at a toasty consistent temperature. Stray too far from the optimum temperature, and things go downhill pretty fast. Conduction, convection, evaporation and radiation all combine to regulate our body temperature. But on a hot day, your body can get warmer from radiation and conduction. That means that evaporation is essential to keep control of your temperature. And do we cool down by evaporation? Sweating.\n\nThis film is the first in a new series that will provide the blueprint for a scientifically perfect summer.
