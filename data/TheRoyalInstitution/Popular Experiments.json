Natasha heads to the prep room to test out air cannons.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nA toroidal vortex ring is formed when a fast moving fluid moves through a relatively still other or different fluid. For example, smoke rings blown through air, or bubble rings in water.\n\nIn our cannon example, to start with, the smoke is basically a fast moving ball. As it emerges through the opening, the smoke outside of the ball is being slowed down because of the friction between it and the edges of the hole. Once it leaves the cannon, there is friction at the interface between the smoke and the air in the room. The smoke in the centre of the ball is moving faster than the smoke around the edges, so the smoke on the edges starts to curl around and form a mushroom cloud. As the smoke reaches the back of the cloud, it\u2019s drawn into the faster moving current of air in the centre. It\u2019s this flow pattern that eventually causes the ring to form.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwH4BpC9M_TVz2wCT4-Ct_z","position":0,"publishedAt":"2018-05-23T14:03:32.000Z","title":"The Science of Vortex Rings","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yjgACB7urOo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yjgACB7urOo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yjgACB7urOo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yjgACB7urOo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yjgACB7urOo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"yjgACB7urOo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"yjgACB7urOo","videoPublishedAt":"2018-03-14T17:25:28.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/0FnX-naIOl7skoJTi4WTT1eo7lU\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad0g0QnBDOU1fVFZ6MndDVDQtQ3Rfei41NkI0NEY2RDEwNTU3Q0M2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Andy takes a closer look at one of his favourite demos from the 2012 Christmas Lectures, bringing together a levitating superconductor and a bewildering M\u00f6bius strip made from over 2,000 magnets.\n\nWe'd love it if you helped us translate this video:  http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/timedtext_video?v=zPqEEZa2Gis\n\nAs his super-conducting boat whizzes along the track, Andy demonstrates the remarkable properties of the superconducting material (Yttrium barium copper oxide) which allows it to seemingly float both above and below the track.\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwH4BpC9M_TVz2wCT4-Ct_z","position":1,"publishedAt":"2017-10-09T15:55:59.000Z","title":"Levitating Superconductor on a M\u00f6bius strip","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zPqEEZa2Gis\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zPqEEZa2Gis\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zPqEEZa2Gis\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zPqEEZa2Gis\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zPqEEZa2Gis\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"zPqEEZa2Gis"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"zPqEEZa2Gis","videoPublishedAt":"2013-06-26T16:52:16.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/-R4WwfWuAZF8JW6C1J9jNxMsCqo\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad0g0QnBDOU1fVFZ6MndDVDQtQ3Rfei4wMTcyMDhGQUE4NTIzM0Y5","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Nitrogen triiodide is a highly unstable substance that detonates when disturbed.

We joined Dr Peter Wothers on the roof of the Ri building in London to show exactly why.\n\nAbove the famous Lecture Theatre, the team set up a clear protective shield around a beaker filled with 150ml of oil. This was heated over a Bunsen until a small fire was burning. Wearing a fire protective suit, Dr Wothers then poured water from a small cup directly onto the fire.\n\nThe reaction is so violent because water and oil don't mix. When the water is poured into the beaker of burning oil it sinks to the bottom and, due to the intense heat, vaporizes into steam almost instantaneously. With this phase change from a liquid to a gaseous state the water expands by up to 1700 times and forces the fire above it upwards. This oxygenates the oil and creates the huge flame you can see in the video.       \n\nPeter Wothers explains more:\n\n\"This is a great reaction to illustrate the topic of our second Christmas Lecture (Water), but it would also have done for Fire too if we had been presenting a fourth lecture. It is one of my favourite demos since it really rams home how dangerous it is to add water to an oil fire. I was never really aware of how large the flames are around me since I was busy concentrating on what I was doing!\"\n\nDevised to promote the 2012 Christmas Lectures, this is one of three large-scale, chemistry demos that were too big (or too dangerous!) to perform in the Ri Lecture Theatre in front of 400 young people.\n\nThis experiment was undertaken under the supervision of professionals and should not be replicated. \n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwH4BpC9M_TVz2wCT4-Ct_z","position":6,"publishedAt":"2017-10-09T16:03:43.000Z","title":"Creating a Fireball - Pouring Water on an Oil Fire","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NC45vREoEOg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NC45vREoEOg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NC45vREoEOg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NC45vREoEOg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/NC45vREoEOg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"NC45vREoEOg"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"NC45vREoEOg","videoPublishedAt":"2013-03-25T13:17:35.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/NNnB7F-8aH50rdZ-KR482XYFV0U\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURad0g0QnBDOU1fVFZ6MndDVDQtQ3Rfei41MzJCQjBCNDIyRkJDN0VD","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Ri Demo Technician Andy Marmery shows us how to light a match without striking it.

Why do high energy collisions in space make solid matter behave in a way that's wholly unfamiliar to us?\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\nCheck out our interactive visualization of all the debris circling the planet: http:\/\/rigb.org\/christmas-lectures\/how-to-survive-in-space\/a-place-called-space\/7-space-debris-visualisation\n\nOur piece of equipment fires a carrot at over 300 km per hour. At that speed, the humble carrot can inflict serious damage on anything that gets in its way. And yet that\u2019s just a fraction of the speed of objects in orbit around the Earth. For example, the International Space Station travels 100 times faster, at about 8 km per second. \n\nTo understand why moving at such high speeds makes collisions so deadly, we have to consider what matter really is. Andy suggests that matter as we\u2019re familiar with it is really determined by the chemical bonds that holds it together, rather than the atoms and molecules themselves. At extreme speeds, collisions have so much kinetic energy that all of an object\u2019s chemical bonds are likely to be broken, in effect resulting in a high-energy explosion as unbound atoms hurtle out in all directions.\n\nSo how do spacecraft protect themselves from these superfast threats? One approach is to use a Whipple shield \u2013 two layers of shield separated by a gap.\n\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZwH4BpC9M_TVz2wCT4-Ct_z","position":12,"publishedAt":"2017-10-09T16:37:07.000Z","title":"High-Speed Collisions in Space \u2013 Experiments with a Carrot Gun","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kStpU1bU-oc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kStpU1bU-oc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kStpU1bU-oc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kStpU1bU-oc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/kStpU1bU-oc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"kStpU1bU-oc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"kStpU1bU-oc","videoPublishedAt":"2016-06-16T09:49:05.000Z"}}]}
