Biology is, at its most basic, chemistry, and chemistry is built on the rules of quantum mechanics in the way atoms and molecules behave and fit together. \n\nAs Jim explains, biologists have until recently been dismissive of counter-intuitive aspects of the theory and feel it to be unnecessary, preferring their traditional ball-and-stick models of the molecular structures of life. Likewise, physicists have been reluctant to venture into the messy and complex world of the living cell - why should they when they can test their theories far more cleanly in the controlled environment of the physics lab?\n\nBut now, experimental techniques in biology have become so sophisticated that the time is ripe for testing ideas familiar to quantum physicists. Can quantum phenomena in the subatomic world impact the biological level and be present in living cells or processes - from the way proteins fold or genes mutate and the way plants harness light in photosynthesis to the way some birds navigate using the Earth's magnetic field? All appear to utilise what Jim terms \"the weirdness of the quantum world\".\n\nThe discourse explores multiple theories of quantum mechanics, from superposition to quantum tunnelling, and reveals why \"the most powerful theory in the whole of science\" remains incredibly mysterious. Plus, watch out for a fantastic explanation of the famous double slit experiment. \n\nWatch this video on the Ri Channel with additional learning materials:\nhttp:\/\/bit.ly\/X826sE\n\nFriday Evening Discourses\n\nThe tradition of Friday evening discourses at the Royal Institution was started by Michael Faraday in 1825. Since that time most major scientific figures have spoken in the famous Lecture Theatre at the heart of the Ri building at 21 Albemarle Street. Notable talks include Faraday announcing the existence of the technology of photography in 1839 and J.J. Thomson announcing the existence of the fundamental particle later called the electron in 1897.\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyGeNsqVL3jmXMpJbNcPXsC","position":4,"publishedAt":"2017-11-06T10:24:58.000Z","title":"Jim Al-Khalili - Quantum Life: How Physics Can Revolutionise Biology","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wwgQVZju1ZM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"wwgQVZju1ZM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"wwgQVZju1ZM","videoPublishedAt":"2013-01-30T14:48:07.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/czupTONFrh2-PRgBB3TLdHg3V3o\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeUdlTnNxVkwzam1YTXBKYk5jUFhzQy41MzY4MzcwOUFFRUU3QzEx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Professor Richard Dawkins discusses the influences and inspirations that have shaped his life and thinking.\n\nChatting to science broadcaster Adam Rutherford in the world-famous Ri Lecture Theatre, the pioneering scientist and public thinker reveals how he developed an \"appetite for wonder\" for the biological sciences.\n\nFrom his upbringing in Nairobi and Nyasaland (now Malawi) to his early experiences with religion, Dawkins talks about his motivations for becoming a scientist and his experiences at Oxford University and Berkeley, California during a period of social and political unrest.\n\nFind out how he arrived at the idea of the \"selfish gene\" -- the basis of his seminal 1976 publication, one of the best-selling popular science books ever written -- and discover more about his research and writing process.\n\nPlus, the Ri audience ask a range of revealing questions -- from how he overcome his natural shyness and stutter at school to what his advice would be to an 18 year old who wants to get into popular science. \n\nFind out more about \"An Appetite for Wonder\" on the Richard Dawkins website: http:\/\/www.richarddawkins.net\n\nThe Ri is on Twitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/ri_science\nand Facebook: http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/royalinstitution\nand Tumblr: http:\/\/ri-science.tumblr.com\/\nOur editorial policy: http:\/\/www.rigb.org\/home\/editorial-policy\nSubscribe for the latest science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiNewsletter","playlistId":"PLbnrZHfNEDZyGeNsqVL3jmXMpJbNcPXsC","position":5,"publishedAt":"2017-11-06T10:23:23.000Z","title":"An Appetite for Wonder: Richard Dawkins in Conversation with Adam Rutherford","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/omsUZ3u5TX4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/omsUZ3u5TX4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/omsUZ3u5TX4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/omsUZ3u5TX4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/omsUZ3u5TX4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"omsUZ3u5TX4"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"omsUZ3u5TX4","videoPublishedAt":"2013-09-25T10:24:06.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/alNC8dp0HekSbPhkx0gGNU9H90Y\"","id":"UExibnJaSGZORURaeUdlTnNxVkwzam1YTXBKYk5jUFhzQy5DNkMwRUI2MkI4QkI4NDFG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCYeF244yNGuFefuFKqxIAXw","channelTitle":"The Royal Institution","description":"Evolution is powered by variation: the differences in DNA sequences.

Jenny Rohn, scientist and novelist, investigates the fascinating world of bacteria in this Friday Evening Discourse event from the Ri.\nSubscribe for regular science videos: http:\/\/bit.ly\/RiSubscRibe\n\nBacteria are our ancient enemies, evolving ever more clever ways of outmanoeuvring our natural defences and scientific technologies. For millennia, a simple cut or cough could kill. With the development of antibiotics, it seemed we would reign supreme.\n\nBut now the bacteria are again gaining ground.\n\nWith antibiotic resistance on the rise, and the development of new drugs having stagnated for decades, we humans might be in a lot of trouble very soon. Why are bacteria so insidious, what tricks do they employ to get the upper hand, and what can we do to stop them? Join Dr Jenny Rohn to explore these questions.\n\nDr Jenny Rohn received a BA in Biology from Oberlin College, Ohio, where she developed an interest in viruses and cancer before moving to the University of Washington for her PhD research into the evolution of feline leukaemia virus.\n\nAfter working as a researcher at Cancer Research UK and working in the biotechology industry in The Netherlands, Jenny gained a Wellcome Trust fellowship to study cell shape and architecture at University College London.
