If you've ever seen seen an ice skater start to spin slowly on the tip of their skate and then speed up into an incredible blur of a spin, the secret is pure science. The best part is that you don't have to be on the ice to test out the science behind the spin. Find an office chair that spins easily and a few weights and you're ready to make yourself dizzy sick.

A medical version of the Tesla Coil called a Master Violet Ray came with an assortment of hand-blown glass probes with promises of curing anything from cancer to baldness. Unfortunately, many of these Tesla Coils were rendered useless after the delicate probes were accidently broken. In 1985, my father, Bruce Spangler, developed a prototype probe that permitted the use of a regular incandescent light bulb in place of original hand-blown glass probes. Bruce is nationally known for his work as a special effects artist and as a collector of museum quality science demonstrations.  In 1991, I redesigned my father's prototype probe and marketed the Visualizer\u2122 to science demonstration enthusiasts throughout the country. Once you try it you'll understand why demonstrators consider it a permanent part of their demonstration repertoire.\r\n\r\nAbout Steve Spangler Science...\r\n\r\nSteve Spangler is a celebrity teacher, science toy designer, speaker, author and an Emmy award-winning television personality.
