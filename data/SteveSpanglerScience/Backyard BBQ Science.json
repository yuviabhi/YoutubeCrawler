You put a bottle of soda in the freezer for a few minutes just to get it ice cold. When you take the soda out of the freezer, it's still a liquid (nothing unusual has happened just yet). However, the second you twist off the cap, the soda instantly freezes! The process is amazing to watch... but it's a real bummer if you were thirsty (because it's tough to suck ice out of the bottle). This is a great illustration of how carbon dioxide can lower the freezing point of water.
