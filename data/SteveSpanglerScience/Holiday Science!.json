You put a bottle of soda in the freezer for a few minutes just to get it ice cold. When you take the soda out of the freezer, it's still a liquid (nothing unusual has happened just yet). However, the second you twist off the cap, the soda instantly freezes! The process is amazing to watch... but it's a real bummer if you were thirsty (because it's tough to suck ice out of the bottle). This is a great illustration of how carbon dioxide can lower the freezing point of water. Get some ice, some salt, and some plastic bottles of soda water and try this very cool science demo. \n\n\nWant more experiments like this?
