The descent to the gaseous surface provides an overview of the structure of the region as the winds and radiation from the central cluster have carved out a long \"valley\" in the cloud. The massive bright stars are responsible for heating the gas to temperatures at which it glows. Their strong stellar winds also blow back the gas around nearby newly formed stars creating tadpole-shaped structures. Within these objects, called proplyds, planets may be forming inside dark, dusty disks encircling the stars.

The sequence begins with a wide-field view of the sky showing the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy, then zooms down to the scale of the Orion Nebula. The visible light observation (from the Hubble Space Telescope) and the infrared light observation (from the Spitzer Space Telescope) are compared first in two-dimensional images, and then in three-dimensional models.\n\nAs the camera flies into the star-forming region, the sequence cross-fades back and forth between the visible and infrared views. The glowing gaseous landscape has been illuminated and carved by the high energy radiation and strong stellar winds from the massive hot stars in the central cluster. The infrared observations generally show cooler temperature gas at a deeper layer of the nebula that extends well beyond the visible image. In addition, the infrared showcases many faint stars that shine primarily at longer wavelengths. The higher resolution visible observations show finer details including the wispy bow shocks and tadpole-shaped proplyds. In this manner, the movie illustrates the contrasting features uncovered by multi-wavelength astronomy.\n\nCredit: NASA, ESA, and F. Summers, G. Bacon, Z. Levay, J. DePasquale, L. Hustak, L.

The sequence features a dense cluster of galaxies about 6 billion light-years away and extends to galaxies at more than twice that distance. Because the light from these galaxies has travelled for billions of years across space, the images show the galaxies as they appeared billions of years ago. In addition, the expansion of space has redshifted the light of these galaxies toward longer wavelengths (i.e., to the red end of the visible-light region and into the infrared-light region). The changes seen in galaxies during the fly-through illustrate the changes in galaxy structure and appearance over billions of years of cosmic history. \n\nCANDELS is an acronym for the Cosmic Assembly Near-infrared Deep Extragalactic Legacy Survey project. One of the largest projects ever done with the Hubble Space Telescope, CANDELS surveyed five fields to study the development of galaxies over time. The CANDELS observations of the UDS field complement ground-based observations from the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. \n\nAstronomers and visual artists extracted over 26,000 galaxies from the Hubble UDS images and created a computer model based on the measured and estimated properties. Note that the distances used in the visualization are significantly compressed for cinematic purposes.\n\nCredits: NASA, ESA, F. Summers, J. DePasquale, G. Bacon, and Z.

The movie starts with a night sky view of the Orion constellation and zooms in. Located above the left side of Orion\u2019s Belt is the vast dark nebula called the Orion B molecular cloud complex. Within this molecular cloud are many bright regions where stars are forming. This video closes in toward one particularly energetic example.\n\nThe movie then switches to an envisioned three-dimensional perspective. As the virtual camera flies into the dark nebula, the stars pass off-screen and the details of the forming stars and their jets of emission are revealed. The central star is hidden by gas and dust, but its prominent twin jets of emission resemble a cosmic, double-bladed lightsaber. These jets have carved an hourglass-shaped cavity in the near side of the nebula. The jet from another stellar newborn in this region has created a cylindrical tunnel through the gas extending to the left. Careful study of the Hubble data reveals a few other jets heating and displacing the gas and dust around them. The nebula provides a vivid example of a gas cloud shaped by stellar emission.\n\nCredit: NASA, ESA, G. Bacon, L. Frattare, Z. Levay, and F.

A black hole, with roughly the mass of the planet Saturn, is imagined to pass over the Inner Harbor in Baltimore, MD. The view of the buildings on the far side of the harbor are distorted using the calculated effects of Einstein's general relativity.\n\nA black hole warps the space around it. Light that passes near a black hole will follow curved paths and can create multiple images and other visual artifacts. Note that the sky can sometimes be seen by looking below the black hole. These distortions are similar to what can be produced using glass lenses, and are produced by similar optics equations. The effects are called gravitational lensing - lensing that redirects light using mass instead of glass.\n\nThe calculations for the visualization use a planar approximation that assumes the buildings are all at the same distance, but are otherwise accurate. Note also that foreground objects, like the boat mast, were not isolated and removed from the image before distortion. In a fully accurate visualization, foreground objects would not be distorted.\n\nFor more information or to download this video, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/25-a-black-hole-visits-baltimore\n\nFor more videos, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbzTIMKMJsUmzLcpYauZ87-x","position":15,"publishedAt":"2014-11-20T21:00:20.000Z","title":"A Black Hole Visits Baltimore","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1VNQ6T0W1bM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1VNQ6T0W1bM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1VNQ6T0W1bM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1VNQ6T0W1bM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1VNQ6T0W1bM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"1VNQ6T0W1bM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"1VNQ6T0W1bM","videoPublishedAt":"2014-11-20T21:00:08.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/wZHMzTRLlj2O0Ccz9DD7hW5pAo0\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRielRJTUtNSnNVbXpMY3BZYXVaODcteC5DQ0MyQ0Y4Mzg0M0VGOEYw","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"The Monkey Head Nebula (also known as NGC 2174) is a star-forming region in which bright, newborn stars near the center of the nebula illuminate the surrounding gas with energetic radiation.

The \"wings\" of the nebula are actually bubbles of hot gas created by stellar winds and high energy radiation coming from a massive, hot, newborn star in the center. A ring of dense gas and dust encircles that star and forces the outflows into two oppositely directed lobes. The blue light in the S106 image represents hotter gas along the interior of the lobes, while the red light comes from cooler gas along the exterior.\n\nThis movie presents a scientific visualization of S106 in which the Hubble image has been augmented with additional field-of-view from the Subaru Infrared Telescope. A couple research articles in science journals described the basic hourglass-like shape of the nebula. Based on those papers, and augmented by intuition and artistic license as needed, the stars and the lobes of glowing gas from the Hubble\/Subaru two-dimensional image have been separated and sculpted to create the depth in the movie. This three-dimensional view illustrates and emphasizes that many of the objects contained within astronomical images are not at the same distance, but, in fact, spread across many light-years of space.

A spiral galaxy has a broad, thin disk shape, with a bulge of stars in its core, Within the disk are winding arms of dark dust lanes and bright star-forming regions, This structure is stable when left alone, but is relatively easily disturbed when another galaxy passes near. Astronomers have studied galaxy interactions for decades, and Hubble's keen vision has been particularly useful for examining new details.\n\nA 2008 Hubble press release unveiled 59 images of galaxy interactions. Each image, however, captures only one moment in a billion-year-long collision process. This visualization of a galaxy collision supercomputer simulation shows the entire collision sequence, and compares the different stages of the collision to different interacting galaxy pairs observed by Hubble. The two spiral galaxies in the simulation distort, twist, and merge together, matching different images at different times and different viewing angles. With this combination of research simulations and high resolution observations, these titanic crashes can be better illustrated and understood.\n\nFor more information or to download this video, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/17-galaxy-collisions-simulation-vs-observations\n\nFor more videos, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbzTIMKMJsUmzLcpYauZ87-x","position":19,"publishedAt":"2014-03-04T21:54:32.000Z","title":"Galaxy Collisions: Simulation vs Observations","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/C0XNyTp5brM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/C0XNyTp5brM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/C0XNyTp5brM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/C0XNyTp5brM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/C0XNyTp5brM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"C0XNyTp5brM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"C0XNyTp5brM","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-01T16:35:45.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ah3Pn0QOEenn8SVa6Y1bCqXQbC8\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRielRJTUtNSnNVbXpMY3BZYXVaODcteC4xMkVGQjNCMUM1N0RFNEUx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"In 2004, the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) provided a ground-breaking view of distant galaxies.

The HXDF contains roughly 5500 galaxies stretching over 13 billion light-years of space, and represents astronomy's deepest view into the cosmos.\n\nThis scientific visualization depicts a flight through the HXDF galaxies. Using measured and estimated distances for approximately three thousand galaxies, astronomers and visualizers constructed a three-dimensional model of the galaxy distribution. The camera traverses through the thirteen-billion-light-year dataset and ends in blackness, not because more distant galaxies do not exist, but because such galaxies have not yet been observed. For cinematic reasons, the exceedingly vast distances in the 3D model have been significantly compressed.\n\nFor more information or to download this video, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/22-cosmic-exploration-hubble-extreme-deep-field\n\nFor more videos, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbzTIMKMJsUmzLcpYauZ87-x","position":20,"publishedAt":"2014-03-04T21:54:32.000Z","title":"Cosmic eXploration: Hubble eXtreme Deep Field","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UTmStdmE6o4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UTmStdmE6o4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UTmStdmE6o4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UTmStdmE6o4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UTmStdmE6o4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"UTmStdmE6o4"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"UTmStdmE6o4","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-26T17:53:22.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/OvrIrPg2coLZ4SbXQFUoZcQvs2I\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRielRJTUtNSnNVbXpMY3BZYXVaODcteC4yMUQyQTQzMjRDNzMyQTMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"The giant planet Jupiter has a diameter of more than 10 times Earth's diameter.

Astronomers found that the double-peaked radio emission corresponded to a giant elliptical galaxy cataloged as 3C 348. Unusually, this behemoth galaxy is not found within a large cluster of hundreds of galaxies, but rather within a comparatively small group of dozens of galaxies. The 'active' part of the galaxy is the supermassive black hole in its core, which spews out strong jets of energetic particles that produce enormous lobes of radio emission. Some astronomers suspect that Hercules A may be the result of two galaxies merging together.\n\nThis video envisions a three-dimensional look at the combined visible light (Hubble Space Telescope) and radio emission (Very Large Array) from Hercules A. The size of these radio lobes dwarfs the large galaxy and extends throughout the volume of the galaxy group. This visualization is intended only to be a scientifically reasonable illustration of the three-dimensional structures. In particular, the galaxy distances within the group are based on a statistical model, and not measured values.\n\nFor more information or to download this video, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/9-active-galaxy-hercules-a-visible-radio\n\nFor more videos, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbzTIMKMJsUmzLcpYauZ87-x","position":22,"publishedAt":"2014-03-04T21:54:32.000Z","title":"Active Galaxy Hercules A: Visible & Radio Comparison","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PBqWy4uTUh8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PBqWy4uTUh8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PBqWy4uTUh8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PBqWy4uTUh8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PBqWy4uTUh8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"PBqWy4uTUh8"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"PBqWy4uTUh8","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-07T01:30:25.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/zlV4maVQVB3IXBxRoodpueLgNPM\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRielRJTUtNSnNVbXpMY3BZYXVaODcteC5ENDU4Q0M4RDExNzM1Mjcy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"Saturn's wide, but very thin, rings are tilted with respect to its plane of orbit around the Sun. Once every 15 years, the rings are edge-on (perpendicular) to the Sun. During those times, some of Saturn's moons can cast shadows across the rings.\n\nThis time-lapse movie shows the icy moons Enceladus, Mimas, Dione, and Tethys orbiting Saturn. Enceladus, seemingly chased by Mimas, is first to speed past the rings and in front of the planet. Both moons cast small shadows on the planet, but only Enceladus casts a shadow on the rings. The orbit of Mimas is inclined so that its shadow misses the rings. Dione is next, and its long shadow also tracks across the ring system. As the three moons move across Saturn's disk, the viewer catches a fleeting view of Tethys as it moves behind the planet on the right.\n\nThe 30-second movie is created from Hubble images taken over a 9\u00bd-hour span. The images were taken Nov. 17, 1995, with Hubble's Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2. The movie has a standard aspect ratio, but is presented within a widescreen frame - the black bars along the sides are normal.\n\nFor more information or to download this video, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/8-moon-shadows-on-saturn\n\nFor more videos, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbzTIMKMJsUmzLcpYauZ87-x","position":23,"publishedAt":"2014-03-04T21:54:32.000Z","title":"Moon Shadows on Saturn","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/L0bohs9OV88\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/L0bohs9OV88\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/L0bohs9OV88\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/L0bohs9OV88\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/L0bohs9OV88\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"L0bohs9OV88"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"L0bohs9OV88","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-07T01:30:25.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/E7NSNbmRIPpqkoCa783h1earq8U\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRielRJTUtNSnNVbXpMY3BZYXVaODcteC41Mzk2QTAxMTkzNDk4MDhF","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"The Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF) peers deeper into the universe than any previous visible-light image. Multiple observations of the same small patch of sky were combined for an equivalent exposure time of more than 11 days. Revealed within the image are thousands of galaxies located many billions of light-years away. Many of these galaxies are too small and too faint to be otherwise seen. Most importantly, because the light from distant galaxies requires billions of years to cross the intervening space, astronomers get to see them as they were billions of years ago. Much of the history of galaxy development can be found within the HUDF image.\n\nThis scientific visualization flies through a 3D model of the HUDF galaxies. Each of the more than 5,000 galaxies in the model was cut out of the HUDF image and placed at its appropriate distance (as calculated from redshift measurements). The virtual camera flies through this long, thin galaxy dataset, showing how galaxy sizes, shapes, and colors change as one looks both out in space and back in time.

Within the nebula, new stars form out of dense, dark clouds of gas and dust. The bright, high-energy radiation from massive young stars erodes away the dark gas. Tall pillars, such as the ones featured in this sequence, form when dense pockets of gas resist that erosion. The illuminating stars for these pillars are located well off the top of the image. At the peaks of two pillars, jets of emission serve as the birth announcements of new stars buried within the clouds. The image is nicknamed \"Mystic Mountain\" and was released in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nLike most astronomical objects, the Carina Nebula is too far away for the Hubble Space Telescope to see in a three-dimensional perspective.

This two-dimensional representation gives the impression that the stars are all at the same distance. In addition, the idea of a \"bright star\" can be misleading, as the apparent brightness we see depends upon both the star's intrinsic brightness and its distance from Earth. This scientific visualization addresses both of these issues by viewing the Orion constellation from a three-dimensional perspective. The true space distribution of the constellation as well as how stellar brightness changes with viewing position is revealed by circling around the stars.\n\nThe camera begins with a pan across the sky to Orion. The lines of the 2D stick figure constellation are drawn in. As the camera slowly begins to circle around the centroid of the stars, the stick figure quickly breaks into a long, extended 3D structure. The camera backs up to keep the entire figure onscreen for the complete circle. At the end of the circle, the camera pushes forward to finish at the location of the Earth\/Sun (to avoid an obvious distraction, the Sun is not included in the visualization).\n\nDuring that final camera push, notice how Sirius grows in apparent brightness (bottom of frame, just left of center). While Sirius is the brightest star in our night sky, a major contribution of its apparent brightness comes from its proximity to the Sun.\n\nFor more information or to download this video, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/5-the-true-shape-of-orion\n\nFor more videos, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbzTIMKMJsUmzLcpYauZ87-x","position":26,"publishedAt":"2014-03-04T21:54:32.000Z","title":"The True Shape of Orion","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WNVY9BcIDok\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WNVY9BcIDok\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WNVY9BcIDok\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WNVY9BcIDok\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WNVY9BcIDok\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"WNVY9BcIDok"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"WNVY9BcIDok","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-07T01:30:25.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/biMQYaGHP7E_vW_bzdc1_3Jxw2s\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRielRJTUtNSnNVbXpMY3BZYXVaODcteC5EQUE1NTFDRjcwMDg0NEMz","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"The dense star cluster called R136 is located within the Tarantula Nebula (also known as 30 Doradus), a giant star-forming region in a nearby dwarf galaxy. Astronomers suspect that the multiple clumps of stars within R136 are actually a pair of interacting star clusters. Supporting evidence for this idea comes from the large number of \"runaway stars\" -- stars moving with unusually high velocity -- that have been found within the nebula. A single, large star cluster would not produce as many runaway stars as two smaller interacting star clusters. In addition, some of these runaway stars are older than the estimated age of R136.\n\nThis computer simulation shows the gravitational interaction of two young star clusters. The 3.5 million years of the encounter have been compressed into just 27 seconds. The smaller star cluster approaches from the left, has its trajectory bent strongly as it swings by the larger cluster, and then returns for a second pass. The visualization then zooms in and dissolves to a Hubble Space Telescope image of star cluster R136. After a partial zoom out, the sequence continues forward in time to show the clusters merging into a single cluster.\n\nAt the start of the simulation, the smaller cluster is not gravitationally bound to the large cluster. After the first interaction, the pair of star clusters become gravitationally entwined and destined to merge together. A noticeable byproduct of the encounter is that interactions between stars efficiently eject massive stars from the smaller cluster. Some of these ejected stars would be considered runaways. Further, the stars in the smaller cluster are a million years older than those in the larger cluster, which would help explain the observed age discrepancies. Finally, note that while all the stars shown are initially hot and blue, some reach the end of their lives during the simulation and evolve into cooler red giant stars.\n\nFor more information or to download this video, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/4-star-clusters-in-collision\n\nFor more videos, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbzTIMKMJsUmzLcpYauZ87-x","position":27,"publishedAt":"2014-03-04T21:54:32.000Z","title":"Star Clusters in Collision","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1ekzgnn_iIw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1ekzgnn_iIw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1ekzgnn_iIw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1ekzgnn_iIw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1ekzgnn_iIw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"1ekzgnn_iIw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"1ekzgnn_iIw","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-07T01:30:26.000Z"}}]}
