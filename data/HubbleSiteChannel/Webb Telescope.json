From its orbit nearly a million miles from Earth, Webb will study some of the most distant objects in the universe -- but first it has to get there. Webb will be folded up inside the rocket that launches it into space, gradually unfurling as it travels to its destination beyond the Moon. This video depicts Webb's journey into orbit, capturing both its travel time and distance and its transformation as it deploys.\n\nCREDITS:\nProduced by NASA and Northrop Grumman\nNarration: Lee Arenberg\nWriter and Director: Jonathan Arenberg\nScript Consultants: Jon Lawrence, Carl Starr, Marc Kirkpatrick, Joel Green, Andy Salvatore, Connie Reese, and Bill Morelli\nTechnical Consultants: Brandyn Bok, Jonathan Lowe, Michale Mesarch, and Karen Richon\nAnimation: Faren Mandel, Vladimir Sierra, Tony Carrillo, and Juan Bautista\nVoice Direction and Recording: Dan Koblosh\nEditing and Music direction: Bob Jaques\nAstronomical Images: HubbleSite.org\nSpecial Thanks: Arianespace","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbwzqhK-D4aE7ARBiDt07UDq","position":0,"publishedAt":"2018-08-15T17:51:11.000Z","title":"Webb Telescope Deployment Sequence","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LiHG-hzeOnM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LiHG-hzeOnM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LiHG-hzeOnM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LiHG-hzeOnM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/LiHG-hzeOnM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"LiHG-hzeOnM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"LiHG-hzeOnM","videoPublishedAt":"2016-06-30T12:49:05.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/-5_bDqZtN5rTQFCXgqXgbTg4q14\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRid3pxaEstRDRhRTdBUkJpRHQwN1VEcS4yODlGNEE0NkRGMEEzMEQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the next of NASA's Great Observatories, following in the line of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope. JWST combines qualities of two of its predecessors, observing in infrared light, like Spitzer, with fine resolution, like Hubble.\n\nThe telescope has a 6.5-meter mirror composed of 18 hexagonal segments in a honeycomb pattern. Protecting the sensitive research instruments is a large sunshield about the size of a tennis court. Further protection comes from the observatory's remote location in a place called the second LaGrange point (L2). Orbiting the Sun at L2, JWST will be about a million miles from Earth (roughly four times more distant than the Moon) and will always be positioned with the Earth and the Sun in the same direction, behind its sunshield.\n\nIn this animation, designed as an homage to a shot from \"2001: A Space Odyssey,\" we fly by and circle around a model of JWST at L2. The opening of the sequence illustrates the L2 location, showing the Moon in the foreground, Earth in the mid-ground, and the Sun in the background.\n\nFor more information or to download this video, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/15-pan-past-jwst-at-l2-point\n\nFor more videos, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbwzqhK-D4aE7ARBiDt07UDq","position":1,"publishedAt":"2018-08-15T17:54:47.000Z","title":"Pan Past JWST at L2 Point","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F_4XxNNCq3E\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F_4XxNNCq3E\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F_4XxNNCq3E\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F_4XxNNCq3E\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F_4XxNNCq3E\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"F_4XxNNCq3E"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"F_4XxNNCq3E","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-07T01:29:44.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/yHQ7tH_WqII7NQ3y9XUKifgmjQA\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRid3pxaEstRDRhRTdBUkJpRHQwN1VEcS4wMTcyMDhGQUE4NTIzM0Y5","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"The James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) is the next of NASA's Great Observatories; following in the line of the Hubble Space Telescope, the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory, the Chandra X-ray Observatory, and the Spitzer Space Telescope.
