The delicate sphere of gas, photographed by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope, is the result of gas that is being shocked by the expanding blast wave from a supernova. The bubble is the visible remnant of a powerful stellar explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a small galaxy about 160,000 light-years from Earth. Ripples in the shell's surface may be caused by either subtle variations in the density of the ambient interstellar gas, or possibly driven from the interior by pieces of the ejecta. The bubble-shaped shroud of gas is 23 light-years across and is expanding at more than 11 million miles per hour (5,000 kilometers per second).\n\nThe unique three-dimensional view of the visualization reminds us that the objects in Hubble images are not all at the same distance, but rather spread across light-years of space. The stars and the shell of glowing gas from the Hubble two-dimensional image have been separated using both scientific knowledge and artistic license to create the depth in the movie. Of note, the relative distances between stars and the nebula have been greatly compressed.\n\nCredit: NASA, ESA, and G. Bacon, T. Borders, L. Frattare, Z. Levay, and F.

Astronomers found that the double-peaked radio emission corresponded to a giant elliptical galaxy cataloged as 3C 348. Unusually, this behemoth galaxy is not found within a large cluster of hundreds of galaxies, but rather within a comparatively small group of dozens of galaxies. The 'active' part of the galaxy is the supermassive black hole in its core, which spews out strong jets of energetic particles that produce enormous lobes of radio emission. Some astronomers suspect that Hercules A may be the result of two galaxies merging together.\n\nThis video envisions a three-dimensional look at the combined visible light (Hubble Space Telescope) and radio emission (Very Large Array) from Hercules A. The size of these radio lobes dwarfs the large galaxy and extends throughout the volume of the galaxy group. This visualization is intended only to be a scientifically reasonable illustration of the three-dimensional structures. In particular, the galaxy distances within the group are based on a statistical model, and not measured values.\n\nFor more information or to download this video, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/10-active-galaxy-hercules-a-in-3d-visible-radio\n\nFor more videos, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbwf3XmigjGkAktb6vFXCF-D","position":1,"publishedAt":"2014-11-20T21:31:15.000Z","title":"Active Galaxy Hercules A in 3D: Visible & Radio Comparison","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mSt6xFpqfUg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mSt6xFpqfUg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mSt6xFpqfUg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mSt6xFpqfUg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mSt6xFpqfUg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"mSt6xFpqfUg"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"mSt6xFpqfUg","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-07T01:29:11.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/dDEWLOW6NaI4MA1Auu_-8syaNcI\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRid2YzWG1pZ2pHa0FrdGI2dkZYQ0YtRC4xMkVGQjNCMUM1N0RFNEUx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"This video is the stereo 3D version of \"Evaporating Peaks: Pillars in the Monkey Head Nebula\". Note that the zoom is 2D, and only the second part of the sequence has stereo 3D.\n\nThe Monkey Head Nebula (also known as NGC 2174) is a star-forming region in which bright, newborn stars near the center of the nebula illuminate the surrounding gas with energetic radiation. This radiation, along with strong stellar winds, erodes away the lower density gas. Pockets of higher density gas resist this erosion, and form pillars and peaks along the inner edge of the roughly circular cloud.\n\nThis video showcases visible and infrared light views of a collection of pillars along one edge of the nebula. The sequence begins with a view of the night sky near the constellation of Gemini and Orion. The view zooms through observations from the Digitized Sky Survey 2 to reveal a Hubble Space Telescope visible light view of the top of this region of pillars.\n\nA cross-fade transitions not only between Hubble's visible and infrared light views, but also from a two-dimensional image to a three-dimensional sculpted model of the region. The camera then pulls back to reveal the landscape of evaporating peaks of gas and dust surrounded by stars. Note that the visualization is intended to be a reasonable interpretation (not scientifically accurate) and that distances within the model are significantly compressed.\n\nFor more information and to download this video, go to the HubbleSite video page:\nhttp:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/24-evaporating-peaks-3d-pillars-in-the-monkey-head","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbwf3XmigjGkAktb6vFXCF-D","position":2,"publishedAt":"2014-11-20T21:30:05.000Z","title":"Evaporating Peaks 3D: Pillars in the Monkey Head Nebula","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tN1RP-rtk24\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tN1RP-rtk24\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tN1RP-rtk24\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tN1RP-rtk24\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/tN1RP-rtk24\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"tN1RP-rtk24"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"tN1RP-rtk24","videoPublishedAt":"2014-05-20T17:27:00.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/g8fvw4bFtqURwK-EJAMrxtkqP9w\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRid2YzWG1pZ2pHa0FrdGI2dkZYQ0YtRC4wOTA3OTZBNzVEMTUzOTMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"This video is the stereo 3D version of \"Celestial Snow Angel: Star-forming Region Sharpless 2-106\"\n\nThe star-forming region Sharpless 2-106 (S106) has a bi-polar shape that, in a December 2011 Hubble press release, was likened to a \"celestial snow angel\". The \"wings\" of the nebula are actually bubbles of hot gas created by stellar winds and high energy radiation coming from a massive, hot, newborn star in the center. A ring of dense gas and dust encircles that star and forces the outflows into two oppositely directed lobes. The blue light in the S106 image represents hotter gas along the interior of the lobes, while the red light comes from cooler gas along the exterior.\n\nThis movie presents a scientific visualization of S106 in which the Hubble image has been augmented with additional field-of-view from the Subaru Infrared Telescope. A couple research articles in science journals described the basic hourglass-like shape of the nebula. Based on those papers, and augmented by intuition and artistic license as needed, the stars and the lobes of glowing gas from the Hubble\/Subaru two-dimensional image have been separated and sculpted to create the depth in the movie. This three-dimensional view illustrates and emphasizes that many of the objects contained within astronomical images are not at the same distance, but, in fact, spread across many light-years of space. Note, however, that the relative distances between stars and the nebula have been compressed.\n\nFor more information and to download this video, go to:  http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/19-celestial-snow-angel-3d-star-forming-region\n\nFor more videos, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbwf3XmigjGkAktb6vFXCF-D","position":3,"publishedAt":"2014-11-20T21:29:38.000Z","title":"Celestial Snow Angel 3D: Star-forming Region Sharpless 2-106","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bwODnCLEzkI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bwODnCLEzkI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bwODnCLEzkI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bwODnCLEzkI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bwODnCLEzkI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"bwODnCLEzkI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"bwODnCLEzkI","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-26T18:24:09.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/QSWrM13qqaSkzOlCerIXGsd3ptc\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRid2YzWG1pZ2pHa0FrdGI2dkZYQ0YtRC41MjE1MkI0OTQ2QzJGNzNG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"This is the stereo 3D version of \"A Horse of a Different Color\".\n\nThe Horsehead Nebula is a dark cloud of dense gas and dust located just below the belt of Orion on the sky. A visible light view shows a strong silhouette resembling the horse's head used for a knight in chess. Infrared light, however, reveals a more complex scene, as shown in Hubble's 2013 image. The warm parts of the clouds glow in infrared light, plus longer infrared wavelengths can penetrate deeper into the clouds. A dark and relatively featureless scene is revealed as a glowing gaseous landscape.\n\nThis video presents a scientific visualization of the Horsehead Nebula as seen in infrared light. To fill out the widescreen frame, the central Hubble image has been augmented by ground-based observations from the European Southern Observatory's Visible and Infrared Survey Telescope for Astronomy (VISTA). The three-dimensional interpretation has been sculpted to create a wispy and mountainous environment, with stars distributed in an approximate and statistical manner. The computer graphics model is intended to be scientifically reasonable, but not fully accurate. This imaginative traverse provides an inspiring spaceflight experience that brings the celestial scene to life.\n\nFor more information or to download this video, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/video_details\/12-a-horse-of-a-different-color-3d\n\nFor more videos, visit: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/videos\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbwf3XmigjGkAktb6vFXCF-D","position":4,"publishedAt":"2014-11-20T21:29:05.000Z","title":"A Horse of a Different Color 3D","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DhvbTScnyHQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DhvbTScnyHQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DhvbTScnyHQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DhvbTScnyHQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DhvbTScnyHQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"DhvbTScnyHQ"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"DhvbTScnyHQ","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-26T17:55:11.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/O0vpXrLPGNQNzEUy43sSuJFgcSQ\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRid2YzWG1pZ2pHa0FrdGI2dkZYQ0YtRC4wMTcyMDhGQUE4NTIzM0Y5","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"This video is the stereo 3D version of \"Mystic Mountain: Bright Pillar in the Carina Nebula.\"\n\nThe Carina Nebula is a vast, star-forming region in our Milky Way Galaxy. Within the nebula, new stars form out of dense, dark clouds of gas and dust. The bright, high-energy radiation from massive young stars erodes away the dark gas. Tall pillars, such as the ones featured in this sequence, form when dense pockets of gas resist that erosion. The illuminating stars for these pillars are located well off the top of the image. At the peaks of two pillars, jets of emission serve as the birth announcements of the new stars buried within the clouds. The image is nicknamed \"Mystic Mountain\" and was released in celebration of the 20th anniversary of the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n\nLike most astronomical objects, the Carina Nebula is too far away for the Hubble Space Telescope to see in a three-dimensional perspective. This scientific visualization separates the stars and layers of the nebula to create depth from the 2D image. A virtual camera flies into the resulting 3D model, which is informed by astronomical knowledge but is not scientifically accurate.
