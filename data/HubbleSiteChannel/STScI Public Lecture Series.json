Imaging spectrographs extend the entire 2D view of an image into a third dimension of wavelength, and have greatly expanded the capacity to map the motions of gas and stars within galaxies.

While we can't standby and watch these developments take place, we can piece together the processes involved just by looking at carefully selected snapshots in time. Messier 83, the Southern Pinwheel galaxy, is a case in point. This galaxy is home to both significant new star formation and at least 7 supernova explosions in the past 100 years. Both stellar birth and stellar death can be studied, and often require observations in different bands of light with both ground and space-based telescopes. Dr. Blair will describe a multi-year, multi-wavelength study of galaxy M83 that has provided detailed insights about its evolution.\n\n-- News from the Universe starts at 4:04\n-- Main talk begins at 24:29\n\nHost: Dr. Frank Summers\n\nRecorded live on October 4, 2016 at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD, USA\n\nMORE INFO: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/about_us\/public_talks\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbyj1SvcQfJ5q5SAssXIB_4R","position":22,"publishedAt":"2016-10-06T14:46:27.000Z","title":"A Multi-wavelength View of Stellar Life and Death in M83","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fRpl4I0ggOo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fRpl4I0ggOo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fRpl4I0ggOo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fRpl4I0ggOo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fRpl4I0ggOo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"fRpl4I0ggOo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"fRpl4I0ggOo","videoPublishedAt":"2016-10-05T01:59:24.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/CsV4G9JXsB_sggm3vPEW57zSwWQ\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRieWoxU3ZjUWZKNXE1U0Fzc1hJQl80Ui5DNzE1RjZEMUZCMjA0RDBB","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"On the Trail of the Missing Galaxies: The Oldest Stars in the Neighborhood\nTom Brown, Space Telescope Science Institute\n\nIn the past decade, wide-field surveys have revealed a new class of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies orbiting the Milky Way and Andromeda. They are the least luminous, most dark-matter dominated, and least chemically-evolved galaxies known. These faint galaxies offer a new front in efforts to understand the missing satellite problem - the discrepancy that theory predicts many more satellite galaxies than the number of dwarf galaxies observed. As the best candidates for fossils from the early universe, the ultra-faint dwarfs are ideal places to test the physics of galaxy formation from that era. New data from the Keck Observatory and the Hubble Space Telescope provide evidence that reionization in the early universe suppressed star formation in the smallest seeds of galaxy formation, thus providing a possible explanation for the missing satellite problem.\n\nHost: Dr. Frank Summers\n\nRecorded live on September 6, 2016 at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD, USA\n\nFor more information: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/about_us\/public_talks\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbyj1SvcQfJ5q5SAssXIB_4R","position":23,"publishedAt":"2016-09-07T01:24:21.000Z","title":"On the Trail of the Missing Galaxies: The Oldest Stars in the Neighborhood","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S-QQ_5pxC7k\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S-QQ_5pxC7k\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S-QQ_5pxC7k\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S-QQ_5pxC7k\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/S-QQ_5pxC7k\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"S-QQ_5pxC7k"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"S-QQ_5pxC7k","videoPublishedAt":"2016-09-07T02:00:35.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/7Fy6S556Ve914h6hzIjXSvRsbVI\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRieWoxU3ZjUWZKNXE1U0Fzc1hJQl80Ui45NzUwQkI1M0UxNThBMkU0","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"The Life Cycle of Dust in Galaxies\nMargaret Meixner, Space Telescope Science Institute\n\nHosted by Dr. Frank Summers\n\nRecorded live on August 2, 2016 at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD, USA\n\nFor more information: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/about_us\/public_talks\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbyj1SvcQfJ5q5SAssXIB_4R","position":24,"publishedAt":"2016-08-03T01:17:29.000Z","title":"The Life Cycle of Dust in Galaxies","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ONJP7G5O8PM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ONJP7G5O8PM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ONJP7G5O8PM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ONJP7G5O8PM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ONJP7G5O8PM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"ONJP7G5O8PM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"ONJP7G5O8PM","videoPublishedAt":"2016-08-03T01:41:46.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/wXYOFgYQpCp2RITk5eexYgYf1Go\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRieWoxU3ZjUWZKNXE1U0Fzc1hJQl80Ui4zRjM0MkVCRTg0MkYyQTM0","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"WorldWide Telescope: Around the Universe in Eighty Ways\nFrank Summers, Space Telescope Science Institute\n\nWorldWide Telescope (WWT) is free, open-source astronomy visualization software.

The New Horizons spacecraft flew just 7800 miles above Pluto's surface on 2015 July 14 capturing thousands of images and spectra of this magnificent \"mini solar system\" comprised of the binary dwarf planets Pluto and Charon and the small moons Styx, Nix, Kerberos, and Hydra. With these new data, Pluto has been transformed from a pixelated blob (as seen from Earth) into a spectacularly complex and diverse world with water-ice mountains as high as the Rockies on Earth and exotic nitrogen-ice sheets with glacier-like flows. Charon has huge chasms bigger than the Earth's Grand Canyon and a giant hood of dark material covering its north pole. New Horizons has resolved Nix and Hydra for the first time, showing them to be highly elongated objects, covered in water ice, and with crater-like surface features. The New Horizons spacecraft is now more than 46 million miles from Pluto, heading deeper into the Kuiper Belt and potentially a close flyby of another Kuiper Belt object, if NASA approves its extended mission phase.\n\nHosted by Dr. Frank Summers\n\nRecorded live on October 6, 2015 at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD\n\nFor more information: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/about_us\/public_talks\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbyj1SvcQfJ5q5SAssXIB_4R","position":34,"publishedAt":"2015-10-23T14:18:12.000Z","title":"The Exploration of Pluto and the Kuiper Belt by NASA's New Horizons Mission","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zGArYfPIlTw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zGArYfPIlTw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zGArYfPIlTw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zGArYfPIlTw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/zGArYfPIlTw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"zGArYfPIlTw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"zGArYfPIlTw","videoPublishedAt":"2015-10-07T02:13:24.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/iqlaGfGYAmOus_qKa3YvOtNWfgA\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRieWoxU3ZjUWZKNXE1U0Fzc1hJQl80Ui45ODRDNTg0QjA4NkFBNkQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"Dr. Frank Summers, Space Telescope Science Institute\nA Trip Through the Light Fantastic\n\nOne of the great advances of twentieth century astronomy was the expansion from visible light observations to the detection and analysis of cosmic objects at diverse wavelengths of light.

These results have been interpreted as a propagating ripple in the fabric of space-time created within the first trillionth of a trillionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. Should this result hold up, it will be one of the most significant advances for cosmology in several decades. Some cosmologists, however, need more information to be convinced.

After ten years of work, an international team of scientists and engineers has now completed a new and highly specialized instrument to obtain the best images yet of nearby solar systems, the Gemini Planet Imager (GPI). GPI can see planets a factor of ten better than any previous instrument. Over the next few years, it will survey hundreds of nearby stars and return images and spectra of dozens of Jupiter-type planets.\n\nExamination of these worlds with GPI opens the way to new discoveries about the properties of planets and observational tests of theories for the formation of solar systems.

In astrophysics, however, gas plays a prominent role throughout the Universe; from planetary and stellar atmospheres to the vast expanses of interstellar and intergalactic space. Gas clouds are also critical to the formation and development of stars and the life cycle of galaxies. Observations of light emitted by gaseous matter in these various environments provides a large and important component of our knowledge of the cosmos. Join us, for a gas-tronomical feast for the mind.\n\nHost: Zolt Levay\n\nRecorded live on June 3, 2014 at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD, USA\n\nFor more information: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/about_us\/public_talks\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbyj1SvcQfJ5q5SAssXIB_4R","position":44,"publishedAt":"2014-06-10T14:50:46.000Z","title":"The Gaseous Universe","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hxl8CsuiYUY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hxl8CsuiYUY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hxl8CsuiYUY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hxl8CsuiYUY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/hxl8CsuiYUY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"hxl8CsuiYUY"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"hxl8CsuiYUY","videoPublishedAt":"2014-06-04T01:16:42.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ONyOx3S08X5UHsrp619uY5JT2dc\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRieWoxU3ZjUWZKNXE1U0Fzc1hJQl80Ui4yODlGNEE0NkRGMEEzMEQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"Moonrise: The Surprisingly Diverse Array of Moons in our Solar System\nDr. Bonnie Meinke, Space Telescope Science Institute\n\nEarth's Moon is so familiar to us, yet there are hundreds of other moons in our solar system that still remain exotic. Take a journey from our Moon to the weird and wonderful collection of moons across interplanetary space. Explore volcanoes, oceans, and clouds that make these distant worlds much more recognizable than one might have guessed.

The most spectacular comet appearances are called \"great\" comets, but such an occurrence is infrequent enough that it is also nicknamed a \"comet of the century.\" In preparation for the Thanksgiving Day perihelion passage of Comet ISON, along with its great possibilities, it's a proper time to examine the humble origins, from the most rural parts of the solar system, of these briefly blazing celestial visitors. \n\nRecorded live on Novenber 11, 2013 at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore, MD, USA\n\nFor more information: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/about_us\/public_talks\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbyj1SvcQfJ5q5SAssXIB_4R","position":47,"publishedAt":"2014-08-11T19:22:17.000Z","title":"Great Comets from Humble Origins & Eyes on ISON","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DiBkYAnQ_CY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DiBkYAnQ_CY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DiBkYAnQ_CY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DiBkYAnQ_CY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/DiBkYAnQ_CY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"DiBkYAnQ_CY"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"DiBkYAnQ_CY","videoPublishedAt":"2013-11-15T15:16:37.000Z"}}]}
