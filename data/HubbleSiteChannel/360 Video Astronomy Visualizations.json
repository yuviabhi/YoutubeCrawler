The contrast between visible and infrared views of the nebula are examined using two spatially matched three-dimensional models.\n\nAs the camera flies into the star-forming region, the sequence cross-fades back and forth between the visible and infrared views. The glowing gaseous landscape has been illuminated and carved by the high-energy radiation and strong stellar winds from the massive hot stars in the central cluster. The infrared observations generally show cooler temperature gas at a deeper layer of the nebula that extends well beyond the visible image. In addition, the infrared showcases many faint stars that shine primarily at longer wavelengths. The higher resolution visible observations show finer details including the wispy bow shocks and tadpole-shaped proplyds. In this manner, the movie illustrates the contrasting features uncovered by multi-wavelength astronomy.\n\nCredits: NASA, ESA, F. Summers, G. Bacon, Z. Levay, J. DePasquale, L. Hustak, L.

For full immersion, watch using a virtual reality device and a 360 video player.\n\nThis visualization journeys into the famous star-forming region of the Orion Nebula based on an image from the Hubble Space Telescope. This exhilarating trip begins by flying through a layer of gas above the nebula, called the \"veil\". The descent to the gaseous surface provides an overview of the structure of the region as the winds and radiation from the central cluster have carved out a long \"valley\" in the cloud. The massive bright stars are responsible for heating the gas to temperatures at which it glows. Their strong stellar winds also blow back the gas around nearby newly formed stars creating tadpole-shaped structures. Within these objects, called proplyds, planets may be forming inside dark, dusty disks encircling the stars. These young stars can also emit jets of radiation which, in turn, create wispy bow shocks throughout the region. All of these features are found in the Hubble image and have been modeled for this visualization.\n\nCredit: Frank Summers, Greg Bacon, Zolt Levay, Lisa Frattare, Massimo Robberto (STScI)\n\nAcknowledgment: Robert Gendler\n\nMusic: \"Blizzard (PON I)\", Kai Engel, CC BY-NC","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbyWWZcoJuDAyskGqmV9HvxI","position":3,"publishedAt":"2018-05-16T16:24:42.000Z","title":"Journey Into the Orion Nebula - 360 Video","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dyRvmDBeYA4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dyRvmDBeYA4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dyRvmDBeYA4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dyRvmDBeYA4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/dyRvmDBeYA4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"dyRvmDBeYA4"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"dyRvmDBeYA4","videoPublishedAt":"2018-02-06T14:44:45.000Z"}}]}
