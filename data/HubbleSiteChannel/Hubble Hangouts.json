these questions and many more.\n\nThis workshop will focus on the interface of models and survey design: how can we best inject and extract astrophysical insight into and from data simulations?\n\nOne of the main aims is to identify common ground between various ongoing data simulation efforts associated with diverse facilities on the ground and in space (e.g., ELTs, JWST, LSST, PanSTARRS, WFIRST, ALMA, Euclid etc.).\n\nPlease join +Tony Darnell Dr +Carol Christian\u00a0and +Scott Lewis as they discuss simulating the universe with astronomers +Molly Peeples and Joshua Peek.\u00a0 We look

Space Telescope","description":"Researchers using +NASA\u00a0 +Hubble Space Telescope\u00a0 have detected a stratosphere and temperature inversion in the atmosphere of a planet several times the mass of Jupiter, called WASP-33b.\n\nEarth's stratosphere sits above the troposphere, the turbulent, active-weather region that reaches from the ground to the altitude where nearly all clouds top out. In the troposphere, the temperature is warmer at the bottom \u2014 ground level \u2014 and cools down at higher altitudes. The stratosphere is just the opposite: There, the temperature rises at higher altitudes. This is called a temperature inversion, and it happens because ozone in the stratosphere absorbs some of the sun's radiation, preventing it from reaching the surface and warming this layer of the atmosphere. Similar temperature inversions occur in the stratospheres of other planets in our solar system, such as Jupiter and Saturn.\n\nBut WASP-33b is so close to its star that its atmosphere is a scathing 10,000 degrees Fahrenheit, and its atmosphere is so hot the planet might actually have titanium oxide rain.\n\nPlease join +Tony Darnell Dr, +Carol Christian and +Scott Lewis as they discuss the atmosphere of this Jupiter-sized  #exoplanet  with the astronomers who made the observations.\n\nRead more here:\nhttp:\/\/hubblesite.org\/newscenter\/archive\/releases\/2015\/25\/\n\n#Space \u00a0  #astronomy   #Hubble25   #exoplanets   #WASP -33b\u00a0  #cosmology  \u00a0  #Pluto","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbwTlN0yVfpfNhnIPqkpkzj9","position":25,"publishedAt":"2015-07-23T20:20:12.000Z","title":"The Atmosphere of Exoplanet WASP-33b","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4QpJ9Xb5v5s\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4QpJ9Xb5v5s\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4QpJ9Xb5v5s\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4QpJ9Xb5v5s\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/4QpJ9Xb5v5s\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"4QpJ9Xb5v5s"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"4QpJ9Xb5v5s","videoPublishedAt":"2015-07-23T20:07:35.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/rxwkN3TUhWOXFsig_F6iFc8xJBo\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRid1RsTjB5VmZwZk5obklQcWtwa3pqOS5ERkUyQTM0MzEwQjZCMTY5","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"The Andromeda galaxy is our Milky Way's nearest neighbor in space.

As these glowing carcasses age and shed weight, their orbits begin to expand outward from the star cluster's packed downtown. This migration is caused by a gravitational tussle among stars inside the cluster. Globular star clusters sort out stars according to their mass, governed by a gravitational billiard-ball game where lower mass stars rob momentum from more massive stars. The result is that heavier stars slow down and sink to the cluster\u2019s core, while lighter stars pick up speed and move across the cluster to the edge. This process is known as \"mass segregation.\" Until these Hubble observations, astronomers had never definitively seen the dynamical conveyor belt in action.\n\nAstronomers used Hubble to watch the white-dwarf exodus in the globular star cluster 47 Tucanae, a dense swarm of hundreds of thousands of stars in our Milky Way galaxy. The cluster resides 16,700 light-years away in the southern constellation Tucana.\n\nPlease join your hosts +Tony Darnell, Dr.+Carol Christian, and +Scott Lewis as they explore this amazing migration of white dwarfs in ancient star clusters.\n\n#Science \u00a0  #ScienceEveryday  \u00a0  #Space  \u00a0  #Hubble25  \u00a0  #Cosmology  \u00a0  #Astronomy  \u00a0  #Spitzer  \u00a0  #Keck  \u00a0  #STEM","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbwTlN0yVfpfNhnIPqkpkzj9","position":32,"publishedAt":"2015-06-12T17:25:08.000Z","title":"White Dwarf Migration in Ancient Star Clusters","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ilJ9aPcwpdI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ilJ9aPcwpdI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ilJ9aPcwpdI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ilJ9aPcwpdI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ilJ9aPcwpdI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"ilJ9aPcwpdI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"ilJ9aPcwpdI","videoPublishedAt":"2015-05-21T20:07:11.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/O8NHhrX4s66axXYqUdRjs9KMzew\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRid1RsTjB5VmZwZk5obklQcWtwa3pqOS4wRjhFM0MxMTU1MEUzQ0VB","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"With images like the eXtreme Deep Field, we\u2019ve seen how the +Hubble Space Telescope\u00a0is used to observe remarkable distances in our Universe, approaching moments after the Universe ceased to be opaque. Astronomers have done it again, detecting and measuring the distance to some of the earliest objects in our Universe!\n\nSince light has a finite speed limit, we know that the further back we look, we are also looking further back in _time_ as well. In a joint effort between HST, The Spitzer Space Telescope and the +W. M. Keck Observatory\u00a0in Mauna Kea, Hawai\u2019i, astronomers have observed light from a galaxy that left over 13 billion years ago! Due to the fact that the Universe is expanding at an accelerated rate, researchers measure the \u201cred-shifting\u201d of light of distant objects in order to see how much the light has stretched as space-time itself is stretched. However the further back we go, the fainter the objects are and make this form of spectroscopy extremely difficult to utilize.\u00a0\n\nSo how did astronomers measure this distant object?

The catalog provides one-stop\nshopping for measurements of objects observed with NASA\u2019s\nHubble Space Telescope.\n\nHubble has amassed a rich legacy of images and other\nscientific data over its 25 years of exploring the universe.\nAll of the images are stored in the computer-based Barbara A.\nMikulski Archive for Space Telescopes (MAST), which\nastronomers use for their research. The archive is\nbursting with more than a million images, which contain\nroughly 100 million small sources ranging from distant\ngalaxies to compact star clusters to individual stars. For\nastronomers, however, a major challenge is the difficulty\ninvolved with sifting through the archival gold mine to\ncollect the data they want to analyze. The Hubble Source\nCatalog now allows astronomers to perform a computer\nsearch for characteristics of these sources, receiving\ninformation within seconds or minutes.\n\nThe Hubble Source Catalog is a database from which astronomers\ncan obtain the Hubble measurements of specific astronomical\nobjects they want to investigate. A query to this database\ncan take just seconds or minutes, while previously it might\nhave required a few months of hard work by searching\nseparate files throughout the archive.

The diminutive object is estimated to be over 13 billion light-years away.\nThis new detection is considered one of the most reliable distance measurements of a galaxy that existed in the early universe, said the Hubble researchers. They used two independent methods to estimate its distance.\n\nThe galaxy was detected as part of the Frontier Fields program, an ambitious three-year effort, begun in 2013, that teams Hubble with NASA's other Great Observatories \u2014 the Spitzer Space Telescope and the Chandra X-ray Observatory \u2014 to probe the early universe by studying large galaxy clusters. These clusters are so massive that their gravity deflects light passing through them, magnifying, brightening, and distorting background objects in a phenomenon called gravitational lensing. These powerful lenses allow astronomers to find many dim, distant structures that otherwise might be too faint to see.\nPlease join +Tony Darnell Dr +Carol Christian\u00a0 and +Scott Lewis as we talk with the Principal Investigators of this exciting discovery.\n\nBring your questions and comments and we'll read them on air throughout the hangout!\n\nRead more here:\nhttp:\/\/hubblesite.org\/newscenter\/archive\/releases\/2014\/39\/\n\n*Special Note*\n\nOur own Dr. +Jason Kalirai has been nominated for a Listener Choice Award for an audio segment on Exploring Exoplanets released last July.\n\nPlease show your support for the  #JWST  mission by listening to his segment here\n\nhttp:\/\/academicminute.org\/2014\/07\/jason-kalirai-johns-hopkins-university-exploring-exoplanets\/\n\nand voting here:\n\u00a0http:\/\/academicminute.org\/2014\/11\/listener_choice_award\/","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbwTlN0yVfpfNhnIPqkpkzj9","position":59,"publishedAt":"2014-12-11T19:55:44.000Z","title":"Hubble Finds Extremely Distant Galaxy in Gravitational Lens","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xpNswEjFh_A\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xpNswEjFh_A\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xpNswEjFh_A\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/xpNswEjFh_A\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"xpNswEjFh_A"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"xpNswEjFh_A","videoPublishedAt":"2014-11-20T21:07:13.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Fmg_nMI0tDDcRcGEuoUYhMN180Y\"","id":"UEwzci1ZdTlDQkRid1RsTjB5VmZwZk5obklQcWtwa3pqOS4zRDBDOEZDOUM0MDY5NEEz","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"Located 260 light-years away, exoplanet WASP-43b is no place to call home. It is a world of extremes, where seething winds howl at the speed of sound from a 3,000-degree-Fahrenheit day side, hot enough to melt steel, to a pitch-black night side with plunging temperatures below 1,000 degrees Fahrenheit. The Hubble Space Telescope has been used to make the most detailed global map yet of the thermal glow from this turbulent world.

We have identified two different telescope architectures, but with similar optical designs, that span the range in viable technologies. The architectures are a telescope with a monolithic primary mirror and two variations of a telescope with a large segmented primary mirror. The concepts invoke heritage from HST and JWST design, but also take significant departures from these designs to minimize complexity, mass, or both.

Space Telescope","description":"Hello Hubble Huggers!  It's time for another Hangout and this time, we're celebrating 23 years of awesome Hubble images with a brand new release from Hubble Heritage.\n\nEvery year about this time, we get really excited because the Hubble Space Telescope was launched on April 24th, 1990 and we're getting ready to mark the 23rd anniversary of the launch.\n\nHubble is a window into our universe like no other, and this week we have another breathtaking view to offer you of the iconic Horsehead Nebula, taken in the realm of the infrared.\n\nWe also have a eye-popping 3D simulation of the Horsehead based on the image you won't want to miss!\n\nPlease join +Frank Summers, +Zolt Levay, and +Jennifer Mack as they discuss the process of selecting this target, the observations, and the making of the new color image and simulation.","playlistId":"PL3r-Yu9CBDbwTlN0yVfpfNhnIPqkpkzj9","position":92,"publishedAt":"2013-04-22T23:41:29.000Z","title":"Let's Celebrate 23 Years of Hubble","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rnPPfmBspaU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rnPPfmBspaU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rnPPfmBspaU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rnPPfmBspaU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"rnPPfmBspaU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"rnPPfmBspaU","videoPublishedAt":"2013-04-22T21:06:44.000Z"}}]}
