The brilliance of the cluster inspired the metaphor of \"celestial fireworks,\" celebrating decades of astronomical accomplishments. To make this beautiful image even more eye-popping, our visualization team processed it into a three-dimensional computer model and created a flight into the nebula. In this episode, Dr. Summers explores the spectacular image and reveals behind-the-scenes details of how the visualization was made.\n\n\nFor more information: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/explore_astronomy\/hubbles_universe_unfiltered\n\nHubble Press Release:\nHubble Space Telescope Celebrates 25 Years of Unveiling the Universe\nhttp:\/\/hubblesite.org\/newscenter\/archive\/releases\/2015\/12\/\n\n\nShow Notes:\n\n-- It is remarkable that the Hubble Space Telescope reached the 25 year milestone. However, that doesn't mean the telescope is \"old.\" The five servicing missions to the telescope provided a continuing series of advances in both the observatory hardware and the scientific instruments. In addition, two decades of experience running the observatory have brought about vast improvements in efficiency and yield. In so many ways, Hubble has increased its capabilities over the years and gotten demonstrably better with age. Scientific productivity is perhaps the best measure of the vitality of a telescope, and on that measure Hubble is a robust as it has ever been.\n\n-- A search for the Spitzer Space Telescope image of the nebula Gum 29 finds an object known as RCW 49. They are the same nebula. There are multiple catalogs of nebulae by different astronomers, at different observatories, at different times. Colin Stanley Gum published his study of 84 nebulae in 1955, while the team of Rodgers, Campbell, and Whiteoak (RCW) produced a catalog of 182 objects in 1960. Other catalogs of nebulae include those of Caldwell and Sharpless. A nebula can be referenced by any of these catalog names, or by the more well-known NGC catalog number if such an entry exists. Unfortunately, there is no one standard naming convention, and cross-referencing between catalogs is a standard feature in astronomy.\n\n-- In many of our visualizations, the stars were handled as image cutouts. If there are just a few hundred stars in an image, the process of identifying the pixels associated with each star is not overly cumbersome. Software written for astronomical research addresses such tasks and can be applied to visualization. However, dense star clusters with many thousands of stars present a severe challenge with tremendous overlap amongst the stars. The point-spread function technique, described in the video, is also an adaptation of research software. Although developed specifically for star clusters, the process can be applied to any image.\n\n-- The development of computer graphics software to support Hollywood movies has greatly benefited our work in scientific visualizations. Astronomy is not a large enough market for specialized visualization software to be particularly profitable. Instead, we use the software written for the billion-dollar film market, and adapt it to our purposes. The sophisticated tools for look development, virtual cameras, and image rendering help add a cinematic feel, while we can keep track of the scientific details and ensure the presentation is astronomically appropriate. We strive for a combination of accuracy and aesthetics.\n\n\nImage Notes:\n\nZoom to Gum 29 (movie)\nCredit: NASA, ESA, G. Bacon, and Z. Levay (STScI)\nAcknowledgment: A.

The iconic \"Pillars of Creation\" shows the tall and beautiful gaseous pillar structures that can form inside star-forming regions. Within these dark clouds, stars are being born. Hubble kicked off its 25th anniversary year in 2015 with some images that used its improved cameras to revisit these beautiful pillars. This larger, higher resolution, and expanded wavelength examination uncovered new details, new features, and new perspectives on a classic image.  \n\nFor more information: http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/explore_astronomy\/hubbles_universe_unfiltered\n\nHubble press release:\nHubble Goes High Def to Revisit the Iconic 'Pillars of Creation'\nhttp:\/\/hubblesite.org\/newscenter\/archive\/releases\/2015\/01\n \nShow Notes:\n\n-- Most will remember that there was an initial flaw in Hubble's mirror that was corrected in 1993. After that repair mission, it took some time for the public to recognize just how amazing Hubble's views of the universe really were.  The 'Pillars of Creation' image, released in November 1995, was a watershed in that regard. The image was shown on television news and reproduced in newspapers and magazines everywhere. The widespread attention helped certify Hubble's status to the public as the pre-eminent observatory of our time.\n\n-- The \"teapot\" in Sagittarius is not the full constellation. It is a star pattern, called an \"asterism,\" within the larger collection of connected stars that makes up the entire constellation. One can search online to see the full Sagittarius constellation as it depicts the archer. A similar asterism is the Big Dipper, which is a star pattern within the constellation of Ursa Major.\n\n-- The visible and infrared views of astronomical objects are generally similar enough that one can identify common structures between the views. When using other wavelengths, like X-rays or radio waves, it can be very hard to identify how the two different wavelength views correspond. Astronomers must record the exact sky coordinates of an image in order to be able to precisely compare against views by other telescopes and in other wavelengths.\n\n-- In 2005, for Hubble's 15th anniversary, we released an image of another pillar in the Eagle Nebula (http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/newscenter\/archive\/releases\/2005\/12\/image\/b\/). This pillar has a long, thin profile that earned it the nickname of a \"stellar spire.\" As seen in this contextual image (http:\/\/hubblesite.org\/newscenter\/archive\/releases\/2005\/12\/image\/i\/), the two pillar regions are near each other in the nebula and both point toward the same group of hot stars.","playlistId":"PL0FEBC25AC2CC2152","position":1,"publishedAt":"2016-03-04T14:10:48.000Z","title":"New Views of the Pillars of Creation: Hubble's Universe Unfiltered","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JqZ2xtsJRGc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JqZ2xtsJRGc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JqZ2xtsJRGc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JqZ2xtsJRGc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/JqZ2xtsJRGc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"JqZ2xtsJRGc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"JqZ2xtsJRGc","videoPublishedAt":"2016-03-04T12:57:16.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/TJycnPq56ugX9Xf5YqHMXkMJD-A\"","id":"UEwwRkVCQzI1QUMyQ0MyMTUyLkMyNzgxMkM4OUVDMUM2ODU=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCqvjEkH_41m4DYaoNQwk4Bw","channelTitle":"Hubble Space Telescope","description":"The Horsehead Nebula is a striking, dark gas cloud just below Orion's belt.
