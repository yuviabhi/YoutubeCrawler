So if you remember from last episode, we mentioned that the first arcade machine, Galaxy Game, happened to have a coin slot, but this was just the beginning. Nolan Bushnell, often considered the Father of the Video Game Industry, saw the opportunity for the commercialization of video games. Bushnell founded Atari and oversaw the development of its first game - Pong. And then, through some questionably ethical business strategies, Bushnell was able to get his machines into arcades all across the United States. But if this is all Atari had done, we probably wouldn\u2019t be dedicating an entire episode to it. Atari also played a major role in getting video games into the home with the Atari 2600 console. Video games were becoming a part of peoples\u2019 everyday lives and they were becoming a part of popular culture. But Atari wasn\u2019t the only video game company in the 1970s, it wasn\u2019t even the first. So we\u2019re going talk about some of the other companies that took part in the war for a place in our living rooms next week! \n\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

Games like Donkey Kong, Pac- Man, Space Invaders, and Centipede had become a cultural phenomenon. These games had expanded the gamer demographic and even encouraged the rise of competitive gaming. There were also many innovations in the home console and computer market with deeper and longer games like Pitfall and Castle Wolfenstein. Suddenly, you could play a game for much longer than your single quarter could get you on an arcade machine.  So the video game industry was booming, but it had also become a sort of Wild West and everyone from Purina to Quaker wanted to get into the action. With these new creators came a glut of choices, and to remain competitive Atari began rushing games to market resulting in some truly terrible games. Gamers started to lose confidence in the industry and then in 1983 the gaming industry in the United States crashed.\n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

Nintendo of Japan, originally a playing card company, which had seen some success in arcades, saw this as an opportunity to (tentatively) introduce its own console to the U.S. - the Nintendo Entertainment System or NES. The NES saw a number of significant technological and gameplay improvements but it was Nintendo\u2019s approach to game development that changed the industry. Nintendo\u2019s defined a new set of standards for video game quality by requiring contracts with all 3rd party developers. Nintendo even used special technology within the console that forced developers to get approval, marketed as a Seal of Quality, for their games to work on the console. And this strategy worked. Nintendo reinvigorated the North American market and became synonymous with quality games. But it wouldn\u2019t be the only new player in the U.S. for long. \n\nCrash Course is on Patreon!

This maturation of games also led us to the software ratings system by the ESRB.

In 1994, Sony introduced their Playstation console which successfully coupled cutting edge technologies with some great games. But Nintendo and Sega weren\u2019t just sitting around. In the 90\u2019s we would see the introduction of the Sega Saturn and eventually the Sega Dreamcast as well as Nintendo\u2019s immensely popular Nintendo 64. And with this new hardware came a new era of immersive games. Games were going 3D, and with the introduction of CD\u2019s, the size of games increased dramatically allowing for much longer and complex storytelling. Local multi-player and split screen games also became popular during this time as consoles such like Nintendo 64 were now powerful enough to support these kinds of social games. And games on the PC were becoming more immersive as first person shooters began to flourish on the platform. \n\nBut Sega saw many failed launches in the 90s due to poor marketing and some poor games. By the end of the 90\u2019s the industry had lost confidence in Sega and even its revolutionary Dreamcast could not keep the company competitive in the hardware space, but it wouldn\u2019t be long before a new player would take Sega\u2019s place. Next week we\u2019re going to talk about Microsoft\u2019s X-Box.   \n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

The early 2000s saw a lot of innovation in hardware and games and we\u2019ll cover some of that, but one significant change that would heavily influence the industry was actually pioneered by that doomed Sega Dreamcast was Internet connectivity. Sony\u2019s Playstation 2, released in 2000, and Nintendo\u2019s GameCube, released in 2001, would also include ways to get online, but Xbox\u2019s implementation of a fully unified network that allowed gamers to compete across consoles was the first of its kind. Now, PCs gamers had been playing across networks, particularly within the popular MMORPG genre, since the mid 90s and we\u2019ll spend a couple episodes taking a closer look at the PC's influence, but today we\u2019re going to focus specifically on how the Internet on consoles helped lead to the prevalence of the competitive gaming and online gaming communities we see today. \n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

In the mid 2000s, we saw a proliferation of Internet accessible devices and with them gaming would expand to a new audience. We\u2019re going to talk about two types of games that are found on these devices, social and mobile games, which together we\u2019ll call casual games. Now, the definitions of these terms can get a little muddy, as they\u2019re continuously evolving, but largely what was seen in the industry was a widespread adoption of asynchronous, socially driven gameplay. These changes spurred the industry to change its profit model, and by 2015, these casual games now make up nearly half of all video game industry revenue. And with their easier mechanics, lower price point, and social component these casual games helped integrate gaming into our daily lives like never before. \n\nAdditional Imagery Courtesy the following Flickr users:\nAndr\u00e9s Monroy-Hern\u00e1ndez (Zynga Image)\nRob Deutscher (Waiting on Vespa)\nEwen Roberts (Plants V Zombies)\nMorgan (QA Testing Battle Rapper)\nJohan Larsson (Doodle Jump)\nOfficial GDC (Independent Games Summit)\n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

Today, we\u2019re going to talk about MMORPGs - or Massively Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games. These games, usually found on PCs, are often nicknamed \u201clife-games\u201d as they have no definitive ending. MMORPGs trace their histories back to early text-based games that were inspired by the the real life RPG, Dungeons and Dragons, which we\u2019ll talk about in a future episode. And with the creation of the Internet, these games have slowly evolved to support shared gaming communities that have exploded in popularity and variety with games like EVE Online, World of Warcraft, and the upcoming No Man\u2019s Sky. But these games and their communities aren\u2019t just interesting to players, they\u2019re also informing us about how civilizations and their economies work. And the economies in these games are actual economies that have real-world monetary value. MMORPGs represent a larger shift that was happening in the gaming community towards livable game worlds as players like never before were becoming a part of the games they were playing. \n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

These two games have been played by millions, and we\u2019ll talk about why they\u2019re so popular (and controversial), but more importantly these two games have helped define two approaches to board game design: the American style board game and the European style board game. Now these two different \u201cstyles\u201d of board games are mostly just over-generalizations about board game mechanics and there\u2019s a ton of overlap, but with the recent resurgence in board game popularity they help us more clearly define two discrete time periods in board game popularity and discuss how these approaches have been defined by the times. \n\nAll attributed imagery was found on Flickr and licensed by cc by 2.0\nhttps:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0\/\n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

Role-playing games are different than most, because they\u2019re technically a form of interactive storytelling with one player managing the game as the game master (or dungeon master), and all of players assuming the roles of their characters. These games started within the genre of wargaming, but reached widespread popularity relatively recently in the 1970s and 80s with its incredibly popular fantasy-based entry Dungeons & Dragons. But with this rise in popularity also came controversy. The United States during this time saw RPGs as an attack on morality and religion and even claimed that these games lured its players into Satanism and black magic.\n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

The PC was the first to bring gamers a number of experiences from adventures in Myst, to first person shooters in Wolfenstein 3D, and of course real-time strategy games with Dune II. And the PC platform continues to grow and thrive with genres that are best and sometimes only possible on this platform.  \n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

Controllers are incredibly important in the gaming experience because they are how we communicate actions within a game and often play a significant role in why we like or dislike certain games. And over the years they have seen some huge improvements mostly brought on by the creation of more complex and immersive video games. Controller design is so important in fact that some of the largest game console manufacturers spend hundreds of millions of dollars each cycle trying to update and refine their designs. But interestingly, the same can\u2019t quite be said for one of the biggest gaming platforms right now - so we\u2019ll talk about that too. \n\n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

Game shows have a long history going all the way back to the 1920s on the radio and then proliferating across media to the massive pop culture icons they are today. And they're different from most game genres we've discussed in this series because chances are most of us won't participate in shows like Jeopardy!, American Idol, or The Price is Right. Even so, many us are innately familiar with them and actively watch them, much like sports. So today we're going to talk about the winding history game shows, the event that nearly ended the genre altogether, and of course take closer look at why exactly they've become so popular. \n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?

Larping tends to conjure up the image of a bunch of nerds hitting each other with foam weapons but it\u2019s much more than that. LARPs merge performance, community, and art in a way that allows players to experience different lives within the safe confines of a game. And it isn\u2019t all just medieval battles either, there are LARPs for just about any kind of game scenario you could imagine, and even some that you might not - like those designed to help players better understand the real-world struggles of oppressed populations. And LARPs aren\u2019t just some niche game, LARPs are played in over 80 countries, and are growing rapidly in participation all over the world.  \n\nSpecial thanks to Kam Abott of the Medieval Chaos Larp (https:\/\/www.medievalchaos.ca\/) for providing many of these images.

Now, gambling is interesting because it could be argued that gambling doesn\u2019t even have anything to do with games. It\u2019s usually about making money after all - which makes it much closer to work. But gambling definitely has a gaming component from its uncertain outcomes to rules of play, and gambling has had a huge impact on the more traditional games we see today. So let\u2019s take a look at gambling\u2019s not-so-certain history all the way from antiquity to the present, and maybe along the way we\u2019ll try to figure out why we like playing these \u201cgames\u201d so much anyway. \n\nWant some Crash Course Games merch?
