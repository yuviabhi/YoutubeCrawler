Working together across cultural and religious divides, they both become very rich, and the Ottomans became one of the most powerful political entities in the world. We also discuss how economic realities can overcome religious and political differences (in this case between Muslims and Christians), the doges of Venice, the sultans of the Ottoman empire, the janissaries and so-called slave aristocracy of the Ottoman Empire, and how money and knowledge from the Islamic world helped fuel and fund the European Renaissance.

As you can imagine, there were a few bumps along the road. It turns out, our old friends the Mongols had quite a lot to do with unifying Russia. In yet another example of how surprisingly organized nomadic raiders can be, the Mongols brought the Kievan Rus together under a single leadership, and concentrated power in Moscow.

You've probably heard of Christopher Columbus, who \"discovered\" America in 1492, but what about Vasco da Gama? How about Zheng He? Columbus gets a bad rap from many modern historians, but it turns out he was pretty important as far as the history of the world goes. That said, he wasn't the only pioneer plying the seas in the 1400s. In Portugal, Vasco da Gama was busy integrating Europe into the Indian Ocean Trade by sailing around Africa. Chinese admiral Zheng He was also traveling far and wide in the largest wooden ships ever built. Columbus, whether portrayed as hero or villain, is usually credited as the great sailor of the 15th century, but he definitely wasn't the only contender. What better way to settle this question than with a knock-down, drag-out, no holds barred, old-fashioned battle royal?

Although freedom was breaking out all over, many of the societies that were touting these ideas relied on slave labor. Few places in the world relied so heavily on slave labor as Saint-Domingue, France's most profitable colony. Slaves made up nearly 90% of Saint-Domingue's population, and in 1789 they couldn't help but hear about the revolution underway in France. All the talk of liberty, equality, and fraternity sounds pretty good to a person in bondage, and so the slaves rebelled. This led to not one but two revolutions, and ended up with France, the rebels, Britain, and Spain all fighting in the territory. Spoiler alert: the slaves won. So how did the slaves of what would become Haiti throw off the yoke of one of the world's great empires? John Green tells how they did it, and what it has meant in Haiti and in the rest of the world.\n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD! http:\/\/store.dftba.com\/products\/crashcourse-world-history-the-complete-series-dvd-set\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@realjohngreen\n@raoulmeyer\n@crashcoursestan\n@saysdanica\n@thoughtbubbler\n\nLike us! \u202ahttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/youtubecrashcourse\nFollow us again! \u202ahttp:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com\nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse","playlistId":"PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9","position":29,"publishedAt":"2012-01-26T19:37:18.000Z","title":"Haitian Revolutions: Crash Course World History #30","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5A_o-nU5s2U\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5A_o-nU5s2U\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5A_o-nU5s2U\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5A_o-nU5s2U\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5A_o-nU5s2U\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"5A_o-nU5s2U"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"5A_o-nU5s2U","videoPublishedAt":"2012-08-16T22:19:26.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/L6ZwHrtKR1bRpehobeO7NjX6Vuo\"","id":"UExCREEyRTUyRkIxRUY4MEM5LjcwQzU3RUIxNjIyRUExODY=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"In which John Green talks about the many revolutions of Latin America in the 19th century. At the beginning of the 1800s, Latin America was firmly under the control of Spain and Portugal. The revolutionary zeal that had recently created the United States and had taken off Louis XVI's head in France arrived in South America, and a racially diverse group of people who felt more South American than European took over. John covers the soft revolution of Brazil, in which Prince Pedro boldly seized power from his father, but promised to give it back if King Jo\u00e3o ever returned to Brazil. He also covers the decidedly more violent revolutions in Mexico, Venezuela, and Argentina.

European powers started to create colonial empires way back in the 16th century, but businesses really took off in the 19th century, especially in Asia and Africa. During the 1800s, European powers carved out spheres of influence in China, India, and pretty much all of Africa. While all of the major (and some minor) powers in Europe participated  in this new imperialism, England was by far the most dominant, once able to claim that the \"sun never set on the British Empire.\" Also, they went to war for the right to continue to sell opium to the people of China. Twice. John will teach you how these empires managed to leverage the advances of the Industrial Revolution to build vast, wealth-generating empires. As it turns out, improved medicine, steam engines, and better guns were crucial in the 19th century conquests. Also, the willingness to exploit and abuse the people and resources of so-called \"primitive\" nations was very helpful in the whole enterprise. \n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD! http:\/\/store.dftba.com\/products\/crashcourse-world-history-the-complete-series-dvd-set\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@realjohngreen\n@raoulmeyer\n@crashcoursestan\n@saysdanica\n@thoughtbubbler\n\nLike us! \u202ahttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/youtubecrashcourse\nFollow us again! \u202ahttp:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com\nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse","playlistId":"PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9","position":34,"publishedAt":"2012-01-26T19:37:18.000Z","title":"Imperialism: Crash Course World History #35","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/alJaltUmrGo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/alJaltUmrGo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/alJaltUmrGo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/alJaltUmrGo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/alJaltUmrGo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"alJaltUmrGo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"alJaltUmrGo","videoPublishedAt":"2012-09-20T21:22:20.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/kN1sAj2LkeBCPCuCxKHoxXgQJf4\"","id":"UExCREEyRTUyRkIxRUY4MEM5LjU0Qjg4QjI0RDQ3MDU4RDI=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"In which John Green teaches you about the war that was supposed to end all wars.

John will teach you how the assassination of an Austrian Archduke kicked off a new kind of war that involved more nations and more people than any war that came before. New technology like machine guns, airplanes, tanks, and poison gas made the killing more efficient than ever. Trench warfare and modern weapons led to battles in which tens of thousands of soldiers were killed in a day, with no ground gained for either side. World War I washed away the last vestiges of 19th century Romanticism and paved the way for the 20th century modernism that we all know and find to be cold and off-putting.

While the rest of the world was off having a couple of World Wars, China was busily uprooting the dynastic system that had ruled there for millennia. Most revolutions have some degree of tumult associated with them, but China's 20th century revolutions were REALLY disruptive. In 1911 and 1912, Chinese nationalists brought 3000 years of dynastic rule to an end. China plunged into chaos as warlords staked out regions of the country for themselves. The nationalists and communists joined forces briefly to bring the nation back together under the Chinese Republic, and then they quickly split and started fighting the Chinese Civil War. The fight between nationalists and communists went on for decades, and was interrupted by an alliance to fight the invading  Japanese during World War II. After the World War II ended, the Chinese Civil War was back on. Mao and the communists were ultimately victorious, and Chiang Kai-Shek ended up in Taiwan. And then it got weird. Mao spent years repeatedly trying to purify the Communist Party and build up the new People's Republic of China with Rectifications, Anti Campaigns, Five Year Plans. the Great Leap Forward, and the Cultural Revolution. These had mixed results, to say the least.

We've all learned the facts about World War II many times over, thanks to repeated classroom coverage, the History channel, and your grandfather (or maybe great-grandfather) showing you that Nazi bayonet he used to keep in his sock drawer and telling you a bunch of age-inappropriate stories about his harrowing war experiences.  So, why did the Axis powers think forceful expansion was a good idea? (they were hungry). So why did this thing shake out in favor of the Allies? HInt: it has to do with the fact that it was a world war.  Germany and Japan made some pretty serious strategic errors, such as invading Russia and attacking the United States, and those errors meant that pretty much the whole world was against them. So, find out how this worldwide alliance came together to stop the Axis expansion. All this, plus Canada finally gets the respectful treatment it deserves.

In the sense of its temperature. It was by no means cool, man.  After World War II, there were basically two big geopolitical powers left to divide up the world. And divide they did. The United States and the Soviet Union divvied up Europe in the aftermath of the war, and then proceeded to spend the next 45 years fighting over the rest of the world. It was the great ideological struggle, with the US on the side of capitalism and profit, and the USSR pushing Communism, so-called. While both sides presented themselves as the good guy in this situation, the reality is that there are no good guys. Both parties to the Cold War engaged in forcible regime changes, built up vast nuclear arsenals, and basically got up to dirty tricks.

You should also turn on the captions. You'll like them.\n\nIn which John Green teaches you about the post-World War II breakup of most of the European empires. As you'll remember from previous installments of Crash Course, Europeans spent several centuries sailing around the world creating empires, despite the fact that most of the places they conquered were perfectly happy to carry on alone. After World War II, most of these empires collapsed. This is the story of those collapses. In most places, the end of empire was not orderly, and violence often ensued. While India was a (sort of) shining example of non-violent change, in places like The Congo, Egypt, Rwanda, Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, things didn't go smoothly at all. John brings you all this, plus pictures of Sea Monkeys. Sadly, they don't look anything like those awesome commercials in the comic books.\n\nResources: \n\nThe Columbia History of the 20th Century - http:\/\/dft.ba\/-columbia20th\n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD! http:\/\/store.dftba.com\/products\/crashcourse-world-history-the-complete-series-dvd-set\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@johngreen\n@crashcoursestan\n@raoulmeyer\n@thoughtbubbler\n@saysdanica\n\nLike us! http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/youtubecrashcourse\n\nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse","playlistId":"PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9","position":39,"publishedAt":"2012-10-26T00:02:11.000Z","title":"Decolonization and Nationalism Triumphant: Crash Course World History #40","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/T_sGTspaF4Y\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/T_sGTspaF4Y\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/T_sGTspaF4Y\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/T_sGTspaF4Y\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/T_sGTspaF4Y\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"T_sGTspaF4Y"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"T_sGTspaF4Y","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-25T23:25:24.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/HL9i8SkpdHW23hJhJBLroUyXXT4\"","id":"UExCREEyRTUyRkIxRUY4MEM5LjBDMDRCRDBCQjcxNkRFNEI=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"In which John Green teaches you about globalization, a subject so epic, so, um, global, it requires two videos. In this video, John follows the surprisingly complex path of t-shirt as it criss-crosses the world before coming to rest on your doorstep, and eventually in your dresser. (Unless you're one of those people who never puts their laundry away and lives out of a laundry basket. If that's the case, shame on you.) Anyway, the story of the t-shirt and its manufacture in far-flung places like China, Guatemala, and India is a microcosm of what's going on in the global economy. Globalization is a bit of a mixed bag, and there have definitely been winners and losers along the way. In this episode John will talk about some of the benefits that have come along with it. Next week, he'll get into some of the less-positive side effects of globalization.\n\nAlso, you should turn on the captions.\n\nThanks to Destin from Smarter Every Day for the cotton footage! http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/destinws2\n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD! http:\/\/store.dftba.com\/products\/crashcourse-world-history-the-complete-series-dvd-set\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@johngreen\n@crashcoursestan\n@raoulmeyer\n@saysdanica\n@thoughtbubbler\n\nLike us!\nhttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/youtubecrashcourse \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse","playlistId":"PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9","position":40,"publishedAt":"2012-11-02T18:52:18.000Z","title":"Globalization I - The Upside: Crash Course World History #41","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5SnR-e0S6Ic\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5SnR-e0S6Ic\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5SnR-e0S6Ic\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5SnR-e0S6Ic\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5SnR-e0S6Ic\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"5SnR-e0S6Ic"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"5SnR-e0S6Ic","videoPublishedAt":"2012-11-02T16:19:32.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/u3A8NNkcuAVGnoeAW4JBGc36S7E\"","id":"UExCREEyRTUyRkIxRUY4MEM5LkVDQjYzQUMxODdDNDM3Njg=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"In which John asks whether globalization is a net positive for humanity. While the new global economy has created a lot of wealth, and lifted a lot of people out of poverty, it also has some effects that aren't so hot. Wealth disparity, rising divorce rates, environmental damage, and new paths for the spread of disease. So does all this outweigh the economic benefits, the innovation, and the relative peace that come with interconnected economies? As usual, the answer is not simple. In this case, we're living in the middle of the events we're discussing, so it's hard to know how it's going to turn out. \n\nCrash Course World History is now available on DVD! http:\/\/store.dftba.com\/products\/crashcourse-world-history-the-complete-series-dvd-set\n\nFollow us!\n@thecrashcourse\n@johngreen\n@raoulmeyer\n@crashcoursestan\n@thoughtbubbler\n@saysdanica\n\nCheck this out!\nhttp:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com\n\nLike us!\nhttp:\/\/www.facebook.com\/youtubecrashcourse\n\nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse","playlistId":"PLBDA2E52FB1EF80C9","position":41,"publishedAt":"2012-11-10T18:01:32.000Z","title":"Globalization II - Good or Bad?: Crash Course World History #42","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/s_iwrt7D5OA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/s_iwrt7D5OA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/s_iwrt7D5OA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/s_iwrt7D5OA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/s_iwrt7D5OA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"s_iwrt7D5OA"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"s_iwrt7D5OA","videoPublishedAt":"2012-11-09T15:37:56.000Z"}}]}
