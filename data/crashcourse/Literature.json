In Shakespeare's time, entertainment choices ranged from taking in a play to watching a restrained bear try to fight off a pack of dogs.

John looks into how the structure and conventions of society in medieval Verona led to the star-crossed lovers' downfall. Along the way, you'll learn about courtly love, medieval responsibility to church, family and society, Chipotle burritos as a metaphor for true love, and even learn about literary sex.

It turns out, it had a lot to do with money and status, and it still does today. John will cover the rich symbolism of the novel, from the distant green light to the pale gold of wealth and decay.

He doesn't take this news well. John touches on all the classic Oedipus themes, including hamartia, fate, and the wrath of the gods, and even gets into some Freud, although Oedipus was notably not a sufferer of an Oedipus complex.

People love Hamlet. The play that is, not necessarily the character. Hamlet is a Tragedy with a capital T (I guess I don't have to point that out, since you can see clearly in the text that the T was capitalized). By Tragedy, I mean virtually everyone dies at the end. John will talk a little bit about the history of the play and the different versions of it that have appeared in the centuries since it was written. You'll also learn about some of the big themes in the play, get a brief plot overview, and the all important connections between Prince Hamlet and Simba, the Lion King. Seriously though, The Lion King is totally just a Hamlet musical with animals instead of people.","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOeEc9ME62zTfqc0h6Pe8vb","position":10,"publishedAt":"2014-06-05T14:43:35.000Z","title":"Ghosts, Murder, and More Murder - Hamlet Part I: Crash Course Literature 203","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/My14mZa-eq8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/My14mZa-eq8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/My14mZa-eq8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/My14mZa-eq8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/My14mZa-eq8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"My14mZa-eq8"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"My14mZa-eq8","videoPublishedAt":"2014-03-14T00:35:32.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/RJISOco-qH-ohc-3daTkGmDA-X4\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2VFYzlNRTYyelRmcWMwaDZQZTh2Yi5EMEEwRUY5M0RDRTU3NDJC","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"You can directly support Crash Course at http:\/\/www.subbable.com\/crashcourse Subscribe for as little as $0 to keep up with everything we're doing.

It really hit the controversial balance beautifully, being edgy enough to make news, but still mainstream enough to be widely popular. It was sort of like the Fight Club of it's day, but not quite as testosterone-fueled.

Vonnegut wrote the book in the Vietnam era, and it closely mirrors his personal experiences in World War II, as long as you throw out the time travel and aliens and porn stars and stuff. Slaughterhouse-Five tells the story of Billy Pilgrim, a World War II veteran who was a prisoner of war, and survived the Battle of the Bulge and the fire-bombing of Dresden, goes home after the war, and has trouble adapting to civilian life (this is the part that's like Vonnegut's own experience). Billy Pilgrim has flashbacks to the war that he interprets as being \"unstuck in time.\" He believes he's been abducted by aliens, and pretty much loses it. You'll learn a little about Vonnegut's life, quite a bit about Dresden, and probably more than you'd like about barbershop quartets as a metaphor for post traumatic stress.","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOeEc9ME62zTfqc0h6Pe8vb","position":19,"publishedAt":"2014-06-05T14:45:04.000Z","title":"Aliens, Time Travel, and Dresden -Slaughterhouse-Five Part I: Crash Course Literature 212","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F6g7S2W27Kc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F6g7S2W27Kc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F6g7S2W27Kc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F6g7S2W27Kc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/F6g7S2W27Kc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"F6g7S2W27Kc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"F6g7S2W27Kc","videoPublishedAt":"2014-05-15T20:58:10.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/EO15G1rJYWfHZ2r6Y3qZoaV4lHk\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2VFYzlNRTYyelRmcWMwaDZQZTh2Yi4yMDhBMkNBNjRDMjQxQTg1","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"You can directly support Crash Course at https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/crashcourse Subscribe for as little as $0 to keep up with everything we're doing.

Anyway, this week, John is going to talk about Slaughterhouse-Five's status as an anti-war novel, and what exactly anti-war novels are good for. He'll also get into the idea of free will, and to what degree Billy Pilgrim's time-travel and abduction by aliens were hallucinations induced by posttraumatic stress disorder. John will even give you an interpretation of why the Tralfamadorians look like toilet plungers. Hint: it has to do with plunging metaphorical toilets.","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOeEc9ME62zTfqc0h6Pe8vb","position":20,"publishedAt":"2014-06-05T14:45:16.000Z","title":"PTSD and Alien Abduction - Slaughterhouse-Five Part 2: Crash Course Literature 213","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HyKhIiGKq5M\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HyKhIiGKq5M\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HyKhIiGKq5M\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HyKhIiGKq5M\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/HyKhIiGKq5M\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"HyKhIiGKq5M"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"HyKhIiGKq5M","videoPublishedAt":"2014-05-22T20:48:47.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Kup_y06sZsuU3UYqxTBaWwHZApo\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2VFYzlNRTYyelRmcWMwaDZQZTh2Yi5GM0Q3M0MzMzY5NTJFNTdE","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"You can directly support Crash Course at https:\/\/www.patreon.com\/crashcourse Subscribe for as little as $0 to keep up with everything we're doing.

I'll warn you up front, this book is something of a downer. That's because it deals with subjects like slavery, the death of a child, a potential haunting, and a bunch of other sad stuff. John will talk about Beloved in relation to slavery, and how that terrible institution affected individuals, families, and all of American culture in the years surrounding the Civil War.

Langston Hughes was a poet and playwright in the first half of the 20th century, and he was involved in the Harlem Renaissance, which was a cultural movement among African Americans of the time that produced all kinds of great works in literature, poetry, painting, sculpture, music, and other areas. The Harlem Renaissance mainly happened in Harlem, the traditionally black neighborhood in upper Manhattan in New York City. Langston Hughes was primarily known as a poet, but he was involved deeply in the movement itself as well.
