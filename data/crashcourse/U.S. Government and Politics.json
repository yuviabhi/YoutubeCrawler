Next week we'll talk about the president's powers NOT mentioned in the Constitution - implied powers. \n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http:\/\/www.voqal.org \n\nThis episode is sponsored by Squarespace: http:\/\/www.squarespace.com\/crashcourse\n\n--\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H","position":10,"publishedAt":"2015-04-11T16:33:22.000Z","title":"Presidential Power: Crash Course Government and Politics #11","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5l02sK5LovI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5l02sK5LovI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5l02sK5LovI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5l02sK5LovI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/5l02sK5LovI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"5l02sK5LovI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"5l02sK5LovI","videoPublishedAt":"2015-04-11T16:33:25.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/3PznqwtmjYibkeDtn_RX44RR0M8\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2ZzZTJuY3ZmZmVlbFRycXZocno4SC5EMEEwRUY5M0RDRTU3NDJC","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"This week Craig continues our conversation on presidential powers by looking at those NOT found in the Constitution - implied or inherent powers.

Implied powers are kind of tough to tack down, as they aren\u2019t really powers until they\u2019re asserted, but once the they are, most subsequent presidents chose not to give them up.

Well, the president has a lot of stuff to do as the chief executive, and as much as Americans like to talk about personal responsibility, the president can't really do all this stuff alone. Because it's a huge job! Same deal with Congress. So, they delegate authority. This is where all the government agencies and stuff come from. The Congress creates them to actually get around to enforcing laws. You'll learn about stuff like OSHA, and the FDA, and maybe even the FCC. Although you hear an occasional complaint about bureaucracies and such, the business of government wouldn't get done without agencies and delegation.\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http:\/\/www.voqal.org\n\nThis episode is sponsored by Squarespace: http:\/\/www.squarespace.com\/crashcourse \n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H","position":12,"publishedAt":"2015-04-24T22:02:21.000Z","title":"Congressional Delegation: Crash Course Government and Politics #13","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UVboes68PkQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UVboes68PkQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UVboes68PkQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UVboes68PkQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/UVboes68PkQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"UVboes68PkQ"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"UVboes68PkQ","videoPublishedAt":"2015-04-24T22:02:26.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ov96b69mMaZwCdT6pAGwe_K0H_A\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2ZzZTJuY3ZmZmVlbFRycXZocno4SC4zMDg5MkQ5MEVDMEM1NTg2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"This week Craig Benzine talks about how the president gets things done.

Bureaucracies tend to be associated with unintelligible rules and time-wasting procedures, but they play an important, though controversial, role in governing. From the FDA to the EPA, these agencies were established to help the government manage and carry out laws much more efficiently - to bring the rule making and enforcement closer to the experts. But the federal bureaucracy (which is part of the executive branch) has a lot of power and sometimes acts likes Congress in creating regulations and like the courts through administrative adjudications. It's all a bit problematic for that whole \"separation of powers\" thing.

Now it's important to remember that the court has granted itself these powers and they aren't found within the Constitution, but as with the executive and legislative branches, the courts rely heavily on implied powers to get stuff done.\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http:\/\/www.voqal.org\n\nAll Flickr.com images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 2.0\n\nhttps:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0\/legalcode\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H","position":20,"publishedAt":"2015-06-27T00:10:31.000Z","title":"Judicial Review: Crash Course Government and Politics #21","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mWYFwl93uCM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mWYFwl93uCM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mWYFwl93uCM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mWYFwl93uCM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mWYFwl93uCM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"mWYFwl93uCM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"mWYFwl93uCM","videoPublishedAt":"2015-06-27T00:10:30.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/SyvaxsSPexCFNl9bFuq4WigcEIU\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2ZzZTJuY3ZmZmVlbFRycXZocno4SC5GM0Q3M0MzMzY5NTJFNTdE","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"Today, Craig Benzine is going to dive into the factors that influence judicial decisions. As you may have noticed, the Supreme Court recently handed down some pretty big decisions on same-sex marriage (in Obergefell v Hodges) and the Affordable Care Act (in King v. Burwell). Now, it's important to remember that these decisions are not made in a vacuum, but influenced by the other branches of government, political affiliations, and past court decisions. We\u2019re also talk about a judge\u2019s judicial philosophy - that is their relative restraint or activism in making decisions on laws. Judicial restraint is often equated with conservatism, but as we\u2019ll show you, this is not always the case. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http:\/\/www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 2.0\n\nhttps:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/2.0\/legalcode\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H","position":21,"publishedAt":"2015-07-10T23:48:10.000Z","title":"Judicial Decisions: Crash Course Government and Politics #22","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QjLcLguoKC4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QjLcLguoKC4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QjLcLguoKC4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QjLcLguoKC4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/QjLcLguoKC4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"QjLcLguoKC4"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"QjLcLguoKC4","videoPublishedAt":"2015-07-10T23:48:09.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/p8lzfspPzkTtH6qywAEmAR66jeM\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2ZzZTJuY3ZmZmVlbFRycXZocno4SC4zRjM0MkVCRTg0MkYyQTM0","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"Today, Craig is going to give you an overview of civil rights and civil liberties.

But it's essential to remember that not ALL speech is protected equally under the First Amendment, and just because you have a right to free speech doesn't mean your employer, for instance, can't fire you for something you say (unless your work for the government and then things get a bit more complicated).

It\u2019s a lot to cover, and we\u2019ll only scratch the surface of the battles these groups fought (and are still fighting) for equality, but we will give you some historical context for the discrimination that has occurred and the court decisioned made to help defend these groups. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http:\/\/www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\n\nhttps:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/by\/4.0\/\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H","position":30,"publishedAt":"2015-09-20T01:31:08.000Z","title":"Discrimination: Crash Course Government and Politics #31","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/P-yviKu8Odo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/P-yviKu8Odo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/P-yviKu8Odo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/P-yviKu8Odo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/P-yviKu8Odo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"P-yviKu8Odo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"P-yviKu8Odo","videoPublishedAt":"2015-09-20T01:31:07.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/kOU4hoHRJMpUa3QgE2MGbTbDs1U\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2ZzZTJuY3ZmZmVlbFRycXZocno4SC45NkVENTkxRDdCQUFBMDY4","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"So we've been talking about civil rights for the last few episodes now, and we're finally going to wrap this discussion up with the rather controversial topic of affirmative action.

So we'll get into the court's rationalization for it in the 70s as well as its fall from favor in more recent years.

So, sure we can say that Democrats tend to be liberal and Republicans tend to be conservative, but we're not going to be talking about political parties in this episode. It's also important to note, that there are going to be a lot of generalizations here, as most peoples' ideologies fall on a spectrum, but we're going to try our best *crosses fingers* to summarize the most commonly held viewpoints for each of these positions as they are used pretty frequently in discussions of American politics. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http:\/\/www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\n\nhttps:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/...\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H","position":34,"publishedAt":"2016-01-13T17:04:00.000Z","title":"Political Ideology: Crash Course Government and Politics #35","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/j_k_k-bHigM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/j_k_k-bHigM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/j_k_k-bHigM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/j_k_k-bHigM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/j_k_k-bHigM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"j_k_k-bHigM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"j_k_k-bHigM","videoPublishedAt":"2015-10-17T00:18:46.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ura6Qrr_ta3oWRAXWXI7AUIYio0\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2ZzZTJuY3ZmZmVlbFRycXZocno4SC4zRDBDOEZDOUM0MDY5NEEz","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"This week Craig is going to give you a broad overview of elections in the United States.

So we'll talk about how some of these cockamamie voting districts come to be and explain how Gerrymandering can affect the outcomes (and misrepresent voters) during elections.

So throughout most of United States history our political system has been dominated by a two-party system, but the policies and the groups that support these parties have changed drastically throughout history. There have been five, arguably six, party systems since the election of John Adams in 1796 (George Washington\u2019s presidency was an unusual case, and we\u2019ll get to that), so we\u2019ll look at the supporters and policies of each of the parties during these eras and look at how historical contingencies cause these policy shifts. We\u2019ll also talk a bit about the benefit of a third party, which although rarely ever wins, helps to influence political debate. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http:\/\/www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\nhttps:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/...\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H","position":40,"publishedAt":"2015-12-11T22:19:55.000Z","title":"Party Systems: Crash Course Government and Politics #41","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PkltAl_cO5Y\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PkltAl_cO5Y\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PkltAl_cO5Y\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PkltAl_cO5Y\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/PkltAl_cO5Y\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"PkltAl_cO5Y"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"PkltAl_cO5Y","videoPublishedAt":"2015-12-11T22:19:54.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/aKkz1SrZAS2RA6TiElMAp5tE6b0\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2ZzZTJuY3ZmZmVlbFRycXZocno4SC4xOTEzQzhBQzU3MDNDNjcz","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"Today, Craig is going to talk about something you fans out there have been demanding for months - money in politics.

So we're going to discuss their strengths and weaknesses and examine how both content creators and consumers play a role in the information that is told. It could be argued that because the media only relays information it isn't actually important to the American political system, but when you look more closely at what and how this information affects voters as well as their elected officials, we can more clearly see its importance as a political institution.\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http:\/\/www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\nhttps:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/...\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H","position":43,"publishedAt":"2016-01-23T18:07:21.000Z","title":"Media Institution: Crash Course Government and Politics #44","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6F0g4N415uw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6F0g4N415uw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6F0g4N415uw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6F0g4N415uw\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6F0g4N415uw\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"6F0g4N415uw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"6F0g4N415uw","videoPublishedAt":"2016-01-16T15:00:01.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/P0EvyGHRw1G14nXoWEsPH6BEVfU\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2ZzZTJuY3ZmZmVlbFRycXZocno4SC41MzY4MzcwOUFFRUU3QzEx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"Today we wrap up our discussion of the media by talking about how the government interacts with and influences the content we see.

The government controls a number of factors including the potential for lawsuits, spectrum licensing, FCC fines, and has even tried to pass a bit of legislation.

We\u2019ll then move onto fiscal policy - that is the government\u2019s use of taxation to raise and spend money. It\u2019s all, well, pretty controversial, but as it seems Americans hate taxes the most, monetary policy is most often used - meaning that the Federal Reserve plays a hugely significant role in steering the U.S. economy. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nSupport is provided by Voqal: http:\/\/www.voqal.org\n\nAll attributed images are licensed under Creative Commons by Attribution 4.0\nhttps:\/\/creativecommons.org\/licenses\/...\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtOfse2ncvffeelTrqvhrz8H","position":47,"publishedAt":"2016-02-13T01:38:05.000Z","title":"Monetary and Fiscal Policy: Crash Course Government and Politics #48","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_tULRch1PRQ\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_tULRch1PRQ\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_tULRch1PRQ\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_tULRch1PRQ\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_tULRch1PRQ\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"_tULRch1PRQ"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"_tULRch1PRQ","videoPublishedAt":"2016-02-13T01:38:04.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/UQ0-oB15AfvtkxJNiZXr2tRdKes\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0T2ZzZTJuY3ZmZmVlbFRycXZocno4SC41RTNBREYwMkI5QzU3RkY2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"Today, Craig is going to talk about social policy - in the United States this means achieving one of three goals: protecting Americans from risk, promoting equal opportunity, or assisting the poor.

Foreign policy is important because it has the potential to affect the largest number of people, but at the same time, it tends to play a minimal role in our perception of the government (unless we\u2019re at war). Foreign policy addresses diplomacy, security, human rights, economics, and the environment at a global scale, and we\u2019re going to talk about how our government has approached each of these policies in the past and which it tends to hold most important. As with all things political, the decisions made in fulfilling these policies can be pretty controversial, especially when considering that the President often has the last word in these issues. \n\nWe hope this series has helped you better understand the way the U.S. government works and hopefully encouraged you to participate in the political process - here or wherever you may live.
