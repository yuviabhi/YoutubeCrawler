Welcome to Crash Course Computer Science! So today, we\u2019re going to take a look at computing\u2019s origins, because even though our digital computers are relatively new, the need for computation is not. Since the start of civilization itself, humans have had an increasing need for special devices to help manage laborious tasks, and as the scale of society continued to grow, these computational devices began to play a crucial role in amplifying our mental abilities. From the abacus and astrolabe to the difference engine and tabulating machine, we\u2019ve come a long way to satisfying this increasing need, and in the process completely transformed commerce, government, and daily life. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\nhttps:\/\/about.me\/carrieannephilbin\n\nWant more Crash Course in person?

Today we're going to talk about a fundamental part of all modern computers. The thing that basically everything else uses - the Arithmetic and Logic Unit (or the ALU). The ALU may not have to most exciting name, but it is the mathematical brain of a computer and is responsible for all the calculations your computer does! And it's actually not that complicated. So today we're going to use the binary and logic gates we learned in previous episodes to build one from scratch, and then we'll use our newly minted ALU when we construct the heart of a computer, the CPU, in episode 7. \n\n*CORRECTION*\n\nWe got our wires crossed with the Intel 4004, which we discuss later. The 74181 was introduced by Texas Instruments in 1970 but appeared in technical manuals around 1969. The design of the 74181, like most of the 74xx\/74xxx series, was an open design which was manufactured by many other companies - Fairchild was one such manufacturer. They produced a chip, the Fairchild 9341, which was pin-for-pin compatible with the 74181.\n\nFairchild was the first to prototype an ALU, building the Fairchild 4711 in 1968 - a one-off device not optimized for scale manufacturing. In 1969, Signetics came out with the 8260, which they marketed in a very limited sense (it was attached, AFAICT, to one particular computer, the Data General SUPERNOVA). TI follows afterwards (March 1970) with the 74181, coupled with the 9341 from Fairchild. The 74181 became the standard number for this part, and was available from many manufacturers (back in those days, chip makers cross-licensed designs all over the place in order to provide assurance that their part could be sourced from multiple manufacturers).\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list...\n\nWe\u2019ve got merch!\nhttps:\/\/store.dftba.com\/collections\/crashcourse\n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\nhttps:\/\/about.me\/carrieannephilbin\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrashC...\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - http:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo","position":5,"publishedAt":"2017-03-22T21:16:49.000Z","title":"How Computers Calculate - the ALU: Crash Course Computer Science #5","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1I5ZMmrOfnA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1I5ZMmrOfnA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1I5ZMmrOfnA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1I5ZMmrOfnA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1I5ZMmrOfnA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"1I5ZMmrOfnA"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"1I5ZMmrOfnA","videoPublishedAt":"2017-03-22T21:16:48.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/UNTcwaMSxEcrYHYk_dE3hj_cyMA\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0TmxVcnp5SDVyNmpOOXVsSWdaQnBkby41MzJCQjBCNDIyRkJDN0VD","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"Take the 2017 PBS Digital Studios Survey: http:\/\/surveymonkey.com\/r\/pbsds2017.

And you\u2019ve probably heard or read about a lot of these - they\u2019re the buzz words attached to just about every new CPU release - terms like instruction pipelining, cache, FLOPS, superscalar, branch prediction, multi-core processors, and even super computers!

For much of this series we\u2019ve been talking about machine code, or the 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s our computers read to perform operations, but giving our computers instructions in 1\u2019s and 0\u2019s is incredibly inefficient, and a \u201chigher-level\u201d language was needed. This led to the development of assembly code and assemblers that allow us to use operands and mnemonics to more easily write programs, but assembly language is still tied to underlying hardware. So by 1952 Navy officer Grace Hopper had helped created the first high-level programming language A-0 and compiler to translate that code to our machines. This would eventually lead to IBM\u2019s Fortran and then a golden age of computing languages over the coming decades. Most importantly, these new languages utilized new abstractions to make programming easier and more powerful giving more and more people the ability to create new and amazing things. \n\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios\n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\nhttps:\/\/about.me\/carrieannephilbin\n\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrash...\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\n\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo","position":11,"publishedAt":"2017-05-10T21:30:47.000Z","title":"The First Programming Languages: Crash Course Computer Science #11","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RU1u-js7db8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RU1u-js7db8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RU1u-js7db8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RU1u-js7db8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/RU1u-js7db8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"RU1u-js7db8"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"RU1u-js7db8","videoPublishedAt":"2017-05-10T21:30:46.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ksBWAGtzp9GviyLTFsik3NLfiZ4\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0TmxVcnp5SDVyNmpOOXVsSWdaQnBkby45ODRDNTg0QjA4NkFBNkQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"Today, Carrie Anne is going to start our overview of the fundamental building blocks of programming languages.

Moore's Law states that we'll see approximately a 2x increase in transistors in the same space every two years, and while this may not be true for much longer, it has dictated the advancements we've seen since the introduction of transistors in the mid 1950s. So today we're going to talk about those improvements in hardware that made this possible - starting with the third generation of computing and integrated circuits (or ICs) and printed circuit boards (or PCBs). But as these technologies advanced a newer manufacturing process would bring us to the nanoscale manufacturing we have today - photolithography.\n\nCheck out Veritasium's video: How Does a Transistor Work?\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=IcrBqCFLHIY\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios \n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\nhttps:\/\/about.me\/carrieannephilbin\n\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV \n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrash...\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo","position":17,"publishedAt":"2017-06-21T21:49:43.000Z","title":"Integrated Circuits & Moore\u2019s Law: Crash Course Computer Science #17","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6-tKOHICqrI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6-tKOHICqrI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6-tKOHICqrI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6-tKOHICqrI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6-tKOHICqrI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"6-tKOHICqrI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"6-tKOHICqrI","videoPublishedAt":"2017-06-21T21:49:49.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/IF6_EtvTMBvzaRzG9NP1ZYUbiz0\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0TmxVcnp5SDVyNmpOOXVsSWdaQnBkby45RTgxNDRBMzUwRjQ0MDhC","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"Get 10% off a custom domain and email address by going to\u00a0https:\/\/www.hover.com\/CrashCourse. \nSo as you may have noticed from last episode, computers keep getting faster and faster, and by the start of the 1950s they had gotten so fast that it often took longer to manually load programs via punch cards than to actually run them!

So today, we\u2019re going to trace the development of operating systems from the Multics and Atlas Supervisor to Unix and MS-DOS, and take at look at how these systems heavily influenced popular OSes like Linux, Windows, MacOS, and Android that we use today. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios \n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\nhttps:\/\/about.me\/carrieannephilbin\n\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrash...\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo","position":18,"publishedAt":"2017-06-28T21:13:18.000Z","title":"Operating Systems: Crash Course Computer Science #18","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/26QPDBe-NB8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/26QPDBe-NB8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/26QPDBe-NB8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/26QPDBe-NB8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/26QPDBe-NB8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"26QPDBe-NB8"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"26QPDBe-NB8","videoPublishedAt":"2017-06-28T21:13:17.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ywO5lalpPYp4tpZtgPnrqW9gWds\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0TmxVcnp5SDVyNmpOOXVsSWdaQnBkby5ENDU4Q0M4RDExNzM1Mjcy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"Pre-order our limited edition Crash Course: Computer Science Floppy Disk Coasters here! https:\/\/store.dftba.com\/products\/computer-science-coasters\nSo we\u2019ve talked about computer memory a couple times in this series, but what we haven\u2019t talked about is storage.

In the years that follow, we'll see the founding of Microsoft and Apple and the creation of the 1977 Trinity: The Apple II, Tandy TRS-80, and Commodore PET 2001. These new consumer oriented computers would become a huge hit, but arguably the biggest success of the era came with the release of the IBM PC in 1981. IBM completely changed the industry as its \"IBM compatible\" open architecture consolidated most of the industry except for, notably, Apple. Apple chose a closed architecture forming the basis of the Mac Vs PC debate that rages today.

It was the first mainstream computer to use a GUI, standing on the shoulder of nearly two decades of innovation including work from the father of the GUI himself, Douglas Englebart, and some amazing breakthroughs at Xerox Parc. \n\n\nPre-order our limited edition Crash Course: Computer Science Floppy Disk Coasters here! \nhttps:\/\/store.dftba.com\/products\/computer-science-coasters\n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios \n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\nhttps:\/\/about.me\/carrieannephilbin\n\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrash...\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo","position":26,"publishedAt":"2017-08-30T21:09:06.000Z","title":"Graphical User Interfaces: Crash Course Computer Science #26","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XIGSJshYb90\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XIGSJshYb90\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XIGSJshYb90\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XIGSJshYb90\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XIGSJshYb90\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"XIGSJshYb90"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"XIGSJshYb90","videoPublishedAt":"2017-08-30T21:09:05.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/Ke4UKieEPx81ilUNSxGtm9oXY-I\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0TmxVcnp5SDVyNmpOOXVsSWdaQnBkby4yQUE2Q0JEMTk4NTM3RTZC","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"Today we\u2019re going to discuss how 3D graphics are created and then rendered for a 2D screen.

Just to clarify we're talking in a broader sense about that massive network of networks connecting millions of computers together, not just the World Wide Web, which is a portion of the Internet, and our topic for next week. Today, we're going to focus on how data is passed back and forth - how a domain name is registered by the Domain Name System, and of course how the data requested or sent gets to the right person in little packets following standard Internet Protocol, or IP.  We'll also discuss two different approaches to transferring this data: Transmission Control Protocol, or TCP, when we need to be certain no information is lost, and User Datagram Protocol, or UDP, for those time sensitive applications - because nobody wants an email with missing text, but they also don't want to get lag-fragged in their favorite first person shooter.  \n\nWant to run traceroute on your computer?

From as early as Julius Caesar\u2019s Caesar cipher to Mary, Queen of Scots, encrypted messages to kill Queen Elizabeth in 1587, theres has long been a need to encrypt and decrypt private correspondence. This proved especially critical during World War II as Allan Turing and his team at Bletchley Park attempted to decrypt messages from Nazi Enigma machines, and this need has only grown as more and more information sensitive tasks are completed on our computers. So today, we\u2019re going to walk you through some common encryption techniques such as the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), Diffie-Hellman Key Exchange, and RSA which are employed to keep your information safe, private, and secure. \n\nNote: In October of 2017, researchers released a viable hack against WPA2, known as KRACK Attack, which uses AES to ensure secure communication between computers and network routers. The problem isn't with AES, which is provably secure, but with the communication protocol between router and computer.  In order to set up secure communication, the computer and router have to agree through what's called a \"handshake\".  If this handshake is interrupted in just the right way, an attacker can cause the handshake to fault to an insecure state and reveal critical information which makes the connection insecure.  As is often the case with these situations, the problem is with an implementation, not the secure algorithm itself.

As computers play an increasing role in our daily lives there has been an growing demand for voice user interfaces, but speech is also terribly complicated. Vocabularies are diverse, sentence structures can often dictate the meaning of certain words, and computers also have to deal with accents, mispronunciations, and many common linguistic faux pas. The field of Natural Language Processing, or NLP, attempts to solve these problems, with a number of techniques we\u2019ll discuss today. And even though our virtual assistants like Siri, Alexa, Google Home, Bixby, and Cortana have come a long way from the first speech processing and synthesis models, there is still much room for improvement. \n\nProduced in collaboration with PBS Digital Studios: http:\/\/youtube.com\/pbsdigitalstudios \n\nWant to know more about Carrie Anne?\nhttps:\/\/about.me\/carrieannephilbin\n\nThe Latest from PBS Digital Studios: https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=PL1mtdjDVOoOqJzeaJAV15Tq0tZ1vKj7ZV\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nFacebook - https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/YouTubeCrash...\nTwitter - http:\/\/www.twitter.com\/TheCrashCourse\nTumblr - http:\/\/thecrashcourse.tumblr.com \nSupport Crash Course on Patreon: http:\/\/patreon.com\/crashcourse\nCC Kids: http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/crashcoursekids","playlistId":"PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo","position":36,"publishedAt":"2017-11-22T22:01:44.000Z","title":"Natural Language Processing: Crash Course Computer Science #36","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fOvTtapxa9c\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fOvTtapxa9c\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fOvTtapxa9c\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fOvTtapxa9c\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/fOvTtapxa9c\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"fOvTtapxa9c"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"fOvTtapxa9c","videoPublishedAt":"2017-11-22T22:01:48.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ng5RIi8M82dt63MBCGujUe88J-Y\"","id":"UEw4ZFB1dWFMalh0TmxVcnp5SDVyNmpOOXVsSWdaQnBkby5BRjJDODk5REM0NjkzMUIy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCX6b17PVsYBQ0ip5gyeme-Q","channelTitle":"CrashCourse","description":"Today we're going to talk about robots!

In the past 70 years electronic computing has fundamentally changed how we live our lives, and we believe it\u2019s just getting started. From ubiquitous computing, artificial intelligence, and self-driving cars to brain computer interfaces, wearable computers, and maybe even the singularity there is so much amazing potential on the horizon. Of course there is also room for peril with the rise of artificial intelligence and more immediate displacement of much of the workforce through automation. It\u2019s tough to predict how it will all shake out, but it\u2019s our hope that this series has inspired you to take part in shaping that future.
