Live coverage will begin on NASA Television and the agency\u2019s website Thursday, June 28, with prelaunch events.\n\nPacked with more than 5,900 pounds of research, crew supplies and hardware, the SpaceX Dragon spacecraft will launch on a Falcon 9 rocket from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Florida.\n\nAbout 10 minutes after launch, Dragon will reach its preliminary orbit. It then will deploy its solar arrays and begin a carefully choreographed series of thruster firings to reach the space station.\n\nIt will reach the space station Monday, July 2. NASA astronaut Ricky Arnold, backed up by fellow NASA astronaut Drew Feustel, will supervise the operation of the Canadarm2 robotic arm for Dragon\u2019s capture while NASA astronaut Serena Au\u00f1\u00f3n-Chancellor monitors the spacecraft\u2019s systems.

Data from ECOSTRESS will also enable other science and applied science investigations around monitoring volcanoes, urban heat stress, wildfires, and coastal and inland water bodies. \n\nNASA monitors Earth's vital signs from land, air and space with a fleet of satellites and ambitious airborne and ground-based observation campaigns. NASA develops new ways to observe and study Earth's interconnected natural systems with long-term data records and computer analysis tools to better see how our planet is changing.
