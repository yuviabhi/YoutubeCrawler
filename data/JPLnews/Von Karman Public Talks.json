To deal with these issues, the state has a vast array of infrastructure in place to store, channel and convey water, much of which also serves to protect against floods. Monitoring and maintaining the infrastructure that carries water where it is needed it is both critical and an enormous undertaking, involving local, state, and federal resources.

Powerful volcanic eruptions result from tidal heating, a process that also affects Jupiter's ice-covered moon Europa. Despite multiple spacecraft visits and spectacular new observations of Io with large Earth-based telescopes, some of the biggest questions about Io's volcanism remain unanswered. Getting the answers requires an understanding of the difficulties of remote sensing of volcanic activity; a new, innovative approach to instrument design; and ultimately a return to Io.

This live public talk at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California, revisits highlights of the last 40 years and discuss what may lie ahead for the intrepid Voyagers.\n\nSpeaker: Alan Cummings, Senior Research Scientist at Caltech and Voyager team member since 1973","playlistId":"PLTiv_XWHnOZr-0Wz9ObrMlwSpb2e2CpTh","position":11,"publishedAt":"2018-07-25T19:41:43.000Z","title":"Voyager: 40 Years in Space (public talk)","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nPSQcXs3DJI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nPSQcXs3DJI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/nPSQcXs3DJI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"nPSQcXs3DJI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"nPSQcXs3DJI","videoPublishedAt":"2017-08-25T20:58:32.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/IKDkKfCBLwrSVuKeX05k7p2YAc8\"","id":"UExUaXZfWFdIbk9aci0wV3o5T2JyTWx3U3BiMmUyQ3BUaC40QTA3NTU2RkM1QzlCMzYx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCryGec9PdUCLjpJW2mgCuLw","channelTitle":"NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory","description":"Original air date: July 13, 2017:\n\nNearly five years after its celebrated arrival at Mars, the Curiosity rover continues to reveal Mars as a once-habitable planet.

It has the strongest magnetic field of any known planet, and its magnetosphere is arguably the largest structure in our solar system. Despite Jupiter's importance, and the fact that it was one of the very first astronomical objects to be studied with a telescope, major aspects of the giant planet remain a mystery.

This is a celebration of a half century of Mars exploration, including portions of the documentary, \"The Changing Face of Mars\" with introductory remarks by its producer\/director\/writer, Blaine Baggett, Director, Office of Communication and Education, JPL.","playlistId":"PLTiv_XWHnOZr-0Wz9ObrMlwSpb2e2CpTh","position":34,"publishedAt":"2016-12-21T17:19:42.000Z","title":"1965: Discovery at Mars","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q5dzDWjN7Z4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q5dzDWjN7Z4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q5dzDWjN7Z4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q5dzDWjN7Z4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q5dzDWjN7Z4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"q5dzDWjN7Z4"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"q5dzDWjN7Z4","videoPublishedAt":"2015-07-20T22:10:01.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/vJNm9c2Iuwzb28x409IdNiZO7Sw\"","id":"UExUaXZfWFdIbk9aci0wV3o5T2JyTWx3U3BiMmUyQ3BUaC41NkI0NEY2RDEwNTU3Q0M2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCryGec9PdUCLjpJW2mgCuLw","channelTitle":"NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory","description":"This talk will consider the study of sea ice, and shall draw on Dr. Kwok's 25 years of involvement in this small, but growing, important corner of Earth science. \n\nWhile the astonishing decline in Arctic sea ice coverage and the smaller opposing trend in the Southern Ocean have occupied the headlines, there are many processes over broad range of geophysical length scales that contribute to character of the ice cover, including ice deformation, ice growth, and snow accumulation. \n\nWe'll look at their observation and role in polar climate.\n\nSpeaker:\nDr. Ron Kwok Senior Research Scientist, JPL","playlistId":"PLTiv_XWHnOZr-0Wz9ObrMlwSpb2e2CpTh","position":35,"publishedAt":"2016-12-21T17:19:04.000Z","title":"On Sea Ice","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/26l2iNw4iJ0\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/26l2iNw4iJ0\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/26l2iNw4iJ0\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/26l2iNw4iJ0\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/26l2iNw4iJ0\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"26l2iNw4iJ0"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"26l2iNw4iJ0","videoPublishedAt":"2015-06-19T20:40:04.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/lOKK-YCLSrGh9b3BH8EAyGI56e4\"","id":"UExUaXZfWFdIbk9aci0wV3o5T2JyTWx3U3BiMmUyQ3BUaC4zRjM0MkVCRTg0MkYyQTM0","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCryGec9PdUCLjpJW2mgCuLw","channelTitle":"NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory","description":"The Search for Planets, Habitability, and Life in our Galaxy\n\nWhat will the first evidence of life outside our own solar system look like?

To tackle this challenge, the Jet Propulsion Laboratory is developing two novel starlight suppression approaches: 1) coronagraphs (an internal occulter) and 2) starshades (an external occulter).

Sea level rise is both a stark reminder of our impact on the climate and its impact on us. The oceans capture over 90 percent of the heat trapped by greenhouse gases, expanding as they warm. They also collect water from melting glaciers and ice sheets, making sea level rise a doubly important indicator of global warming. Without adaptation, a 2-meter rise would displace 187 million people worldwide. Sea level will continue to rise, but how fast? Like its predecessors, Jason-3 will serve as our eyes on sea level rise. Measuring global sea level once every 10 days, it will chart out the global rise of the oceans--a rise that is unlikely to subside or reverse for generations. But Jason-3 will be more than a sentinel of climate change. It will also measure the tilt of the ocean surface providing oceanographers with information about ocean currents, measure wind and waves helping forecasters predict marine weather, and even find local warm spots that can intensify hurricanes. \n\nSpeaker:\nDr. Joshua Willis \u2013 Jason-3 Project Scientist","playlistId":"PLTiv_XWHnOZr-0Wz9ObrMlwSpb2e2CpTh","position":38,"publishedAt":"2017-03-20T21:13:24.000Z","title":"Charting Irreversible Climate Change with Jason-3","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BqHbkkt_iL8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BqHbkkt_iL8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BqHbkkt_iL8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BqHbkkt_iL8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/BqHbkkt_iL8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"BqHbkkt_iL8"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"BqHbkkt_iL8","videoPublishedAt":"2015-02-13T18:22:18.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/0r2aWhlrfvNGwF0hUmQ5lnvlEIM\"","id":"UExUaXZfWFdIbk9aci0wV3o5T2JyTWx3U3BiMmUyQ3BUaC41RTNBREYwMkI5QzU3RkY2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCryGec9PdUCLjpJW2mgCuLw","channelTitle":"NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory","description":"How would you like to swim in the oceans of Europa?
