The result was an intriguing, low-resolution glimpse of what our world would look like to a visitor from afar. \n\nThe cameras that took the images for the movie are located near the pointed tip of one of the spacecraft's three solar-array arms. They are part of Juno's Magnetic Field Investigation (MAG) and are normally used to determine the orientation of the magnetic sensors. These cameras look away from the sunlit side of the solar array, so as the spacecraft approached, the system's four cameras pointed toward Earth. Earth and the moon came into view when Juno was about 600,000 miles (966,000 kilometers) away -- about three times the Earth-moon separation. \n\nDuring the flyby, timing was everything. Juno was traveling about twice as fast as a typical satellite, and the spacecraft itself was spinning at 2 rpm. To assemble a movie that wouldn't make viewers dizzy, the star tracker had to capture a frame each time the camera was facing Earth at exactly the right instant. The frames were sent to Earth, where they were processed into video format. \n\nThe music accompaniment is an original score by Vangelis.\n\nThe full image caption for this movie is available at: http:\/\/photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov\/catalog\/PIA17748","playlistId":"PLTiv_XWHnOZpVYDJ9GkooA0BnkNAKj9ot","position":9,"publishedAt":"2016-07-01T04:34:08.000Z","title":"Earth and Moon Seen by Passing Juno Spacecraft with Music by Vangelis","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_CzBlSXgzqI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_CzBlSXgzqI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_CzBlSXgzqI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_CzBlSXgzqI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_CzBlSXgzqI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"_CzBlSXgzqI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"_CzBlSXgzqI","videoPublishedAt":"2013-12-10T18:26:22.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/vsXGRe2-ZldC_OdyIbi8KjpMjpI\"","id":"UExUaXZfWFdIbk9acFZZREo5R2tvb0EwQm5rTkFLajlvdC4xMkVGQjNCMUM1N0RFNEUx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCryGec9PdUCLjpJW2mgCuLw","channelTitle":"NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory","description":"As NASA's Jupiter-bound Juno spacecraft swung past Earth on Oct. 9, 2013,  amateur radio operators around the world sent a Morse Code \"HI\" to the spacecraft.
