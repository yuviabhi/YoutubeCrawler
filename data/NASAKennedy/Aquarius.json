A United Launch Alliance Delta II rocket will launch the spacecraft, SAC-D, into a polar orbit from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, allowing it to fly over the world's ocean and collect data. The readings are expected to be the most complete study of the salinity ever completed. Argentina built the spacecraft, SAC-D, and NASA provided the primary instrument called Aquarius. Several other nations are also taking part in the mission.\r\n\r\nIf a recognizable person appears in this video, use for commercial purposes may infringe a right of privacy or publicity.
