The American Museum of Natural History purchased the island in 1949 to preserve a breeding habitat for terns displaced from Long Island's beaches by increasing development. \n\nProject director Helen Hays has led the Museum's research efforts on Great Gull Island since 1969. Among the field team's discoveries was the early documentation of the harmful environmental effects of PCBs\u2014chemicals widely used in coolants, paints, and other compounds.\n\nEach summer, a small group of Museum members has the rare opportunity to visit the Great Gull Island colony of nesting terns.
