Even though water makes up only 0.03 percent of the Earth\u2019s total mass, it covers 70 percent of the planet\u2019s surface. Where did this water come from? Why is it mostly in liquid form? How much of it is drinkable and how vulnerable is this valuable resource? Will we ever run out? Will wars of the future be fought over access to it? Will future generations harness water from space? Is water essential to all life in the universe\u2014or just to life on Earth?\n\n2015 Asimov Panelists include:\n\n-Heidi Hammel, Planetary Astronomer,Executive Vice President of the Association of Universities for Research in Astronomy\n-Tess Russo,Hydrologist,Assistant Professor in the Department of Geosciences at Pennsylvania State University\u00a0\n-Ellen Stofan, Planetary Geologist, Chief Scientist of NASA\n-Kathryn Sullivan, Geologist, Under Secretary of Commerce for Oceans and Atmosphere and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Administrator\n-Charles Wald, General, U.S. Air Force, Retired; Director and Senior Advisor to the aerospace and defense industry for Deloitte LP\n\nThe late Dr. Isaac Asimov, one of the most prolific and influential authors of our time, was a dear friend and supporter of the American Museum of Natural History.\u00a0 In his memory, the Hayden Planetarium is honored to host the annual Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate \u2014 generously endowed by relatives, friends, and admirers of Isaac Asimov and his work \u2014 bringing the finest minds in the world to the Museum each year to debate pressing questions on the frontier of scientific discovery.\u00a0 Proceeds from ticket sales of the Isaac Asimov Memorial Debates benefit the scientific and educational programs of the Hayden Planetarium.\n\n2017 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: De-Extinction\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_LnAtMeSVeY&index=1&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2016 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Is the Universe a Simulation? \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wgSZA3NPpBs&index=2&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2015 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Water, Water \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FSF79uS3t04&index=3&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2014 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Selling Space \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GbmFeEIKBFI&index=4&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2013 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: The Existence of Nothing \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1OLz6uUuMp8&index=5&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2012 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Faster Than the Speed of Light \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5qlLW60wOjo&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ&index=6\n\n2011 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: The Theory of Everything \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Eb8_3BUHcuw&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ&index=7\n\nRose Center Anniversary Isaac Asimov Debate: Is Earth Unique? \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9Ji_GdAk9vU&index=8&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ&t=25s\n\n***\nSubscribe to our channel: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/subscription_center?add_user=AMNHorg\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/AMNHorg\n\nFacebook: http:\/\/fb.com\/naturalhistory \nTwitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/amnh\nTumblr: http:\/\/amnhnyc.tumblr.com\/\nInstagram: http:\/\/instagram.com\/amnh","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwGonX2xITlfHmb1RcM2DGJv","position":0,"publishedAt":"2018-02-08T22:28:15.000Z","title":"2015 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Water, Water","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FSF79uS3t04\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FSF79uS3t04\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FSF79uS3t04\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FSF79uS3t04\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"FSF79uS3t04"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"FSF79uS3t04","videoPublishedAt":"2015-05-01T19:10:13.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/WpTD34Fxw4WJ7TOBzmmf395hllo\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3R29uWDJ4SVRsZkhtYjFSY00yREdKdi4yODlGNEE0NkRGMEEzMEQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Since the first extrasolar planet was discovered in 1995, astronomers have gathered and analyzed telescope data revealing over 1,000 worlds orbiting other stars.

Scientists in New Zealand are examining samples from the rocky landscape once dominated by glaciers. They are employing a new technique called surface exposure dating, which uses chemical analysis to determine how long minerals within rocks have been exposed to the air since the glaciers around them melted. Comparisons of this data with other climate records have revealed a link between glacial retreat and rising levels of carbon dioxide in the air, findings that are informing scientists' understanding of  global climate change today. \n\nScience Bulletins is a production of the National Center for Science Literacy, Education, and Technology (NCSLET), part of the Department of Education at the American Museum of Natural History.

Two research teams independently determined that the 24 Themis asteroid, which orbits between Mars and Jupiter, is completely covered in a thin layer of frost. The discovery indicates that comets and asteroids may be more similar than previously thought. Comets are traditionally defined as small lumps of rock and ice that form vapor tails when they venture close to the Sun. Asteroids are usually characterized as large dry rocks. Now the distinction between these two types of space rock is not so clear.\n\nThe ice on 24 Themis appears to have been present for billions of years. Researchers suggest that an icy reservoir within the asteroid may continually replenish the surface frost. This find is prompting astronomers to hypothesize that an asteroid collision with early Earth might explain how water was delivered to our planet.","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwGonX2xITlfHmb1RcM2DGJv","position":4,"publishedAt":"2018-02-08T22:57:41.000Z","title":"Science Bulletins: New Evidence of Water on Asteroids","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WCzO12q-IIs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WCzO12q-IIs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/WCzO12q-IIs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"WCzO12q-IIs"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"WCzO12q-IIs","videoPublishedAt":"2012-06-14T16:17:50.000Z"}}]}
