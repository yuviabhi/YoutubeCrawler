Even the word \"pterosaur\" (TER-o-soar) can trip up readers with its silent \"p\" (the word originates from the Greek pteron, for wing, and sauros, for lizard). Now, you can brush up on tongue-twisting pterosaur genus names, from Jeholopterus to Quetzalcoatlus, with a pronunciation guide featuring students from the Museum's education programs.\n\nPterosaurs are named according to a set of rules called the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, with scientific names including the genus and species. The first person to describe a pterosaur assigns the animal its name, which is often derived from Greek or Latin words or references the place where the specimen was collected or unusual anatomical characteristics. The species Quetzalcoatlus northropi, discovered in southwestern Texas, was named after Quetzalcoatl, a Mexican god of the air, and the industrialist Jack Northrop, known for developing a stealth aircraft called the flying wing.\n\nPterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs is on view from April 5, 2014, through January 4, 2015.

So it is not surprising that dinosaurs did, too, especially since we can observe combat in the closest living relatives of extinct dinosaurs, crocodiles and birds. But direct evidence of fighting in extinct dinosaurs is rare.\n\nThe most spectacular example of predator\/prey combat in extinct dinosaurs was discovered in Mongolia. A carnivorous theropod, Velociraptor, is entwined in a 72-million-year-old death struggle with a primitive, herbivorous, horned dinosaur, Protoceratops. The right arm of the Velociraptor is caught in the mouth of the Protoceratops, and the hand of Velociraptor grasps the face of its foe. The large sickle-shaped claw on the hind foot of Velociraptor is imbedded in the neck of the Protoceratops, right where the carotid artery would be. The exact circumstances surrounding the scene are unknown, but the position of the bones document that the animals were interacting while they were alive.\n\nTwo other specimens document combat between individuals of the same species. One is a 65-million-year-old skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex discovered in South Dakota. This bad boy was really beat up. One eye socket in the skull is nearly closed by abnormal healing of the surrounding bone. On another part of the skull, the broken tip of a tooth from another tyrannosaur in embedded. Around this tooth are the characteristic marks of bone growth that occurs during healing, indicating that the animal survived the attack. Another skull of Velociraptor from Mongolia exhibits two rows of parallel punctures on the frontal bone that appear to be tooth marks. The pattern of tooth marks corresponds identically with the spacing of teeth in the upper jaw of Velociraptor. No healing of bone is evident, suggesting that the rival dealt a fatal blow to the victim's brain.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

But did extinct, non-avian dinosaurs do the same? Over the last several decades, numerous claims have been made that they did, but finding unequivocal evidence of herding in the fossil record is difficult.\n\nThe most definitive evidence comes from sequences of fossilized footprints called trackways. Several track sites have now been found that suggest herding behavior in some groups of dinosaurs. At the Davenport Ranch site outside San Antonio, Texas, R. T. Bird of AMNH discovered an amazing set of sauropods tracks in 1940. Detailed analyses of these trackways reveal a herd of 23 sauropods rambling over muddy ground at a pace of about 2 meters per second. The pattern of overlapping tracks indicates that the largest adult sauropods led the herd, followed by smaller individuals. \n\nOther trackways in Colorado and Korea show herds of large sauropods moving side-by-side in a horizontal front. At one site in Colorado, the animals' paths undulate from left to right in unison.\n\nTrackways of meat-eating theropods are less common, but one occurrence is Bird's specimen from Glen Rose, Texas, a part of which is on display at AMNH. In all, the Paluxy River trackways, some of which were sent to other institutions, reveal the footprints of at least 12 sauropods and at least three, large, carnivorous dinosaurs moving along a mudflat above the waterline. But it is unclear how long after the sauropods passed that the theropods followed or if they moved in a pack. However, in Bolivia, paleontologist Giusseppe Leonardi discovered eight parallel trackways of six adult and two juvenile sauropods moving along the shore in a front, followed shortly afterward by a pack of at least 32 medium sized, carnivorous theropods, moving in the same general direction along the same front.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

In part, this shift reflects the scientific switch from viewing dinosaurs as drab relatives of crocodiles and lizards to viewing dinosaurs as closer relatives of birds. But is there any direct fossil evidence for this change? Well, the answer is no... and yes.\n\nNo fossils of extinct dinosaurs, including \"mummies\" complete with fossilized skin impressions, have yet revealed the true color of the dinosaur's skin, at least in terms of what we usually think of as skin. There are fossils of a couple of turtles from the Cenozoic Era that are thought to preserve the pattern of pigmentation on the shell. Nonetheless, in terms of non-feathered dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus and duckbills, no evidence for skin color has yet been found.\n\nRecently, however, a great wealth of astounding fossils representing small, feathered dinosaurs that are not birds has been collected in Early Cretaceous rocks in China, especially near Liaoning. Fossilized feathers, basically modified scales that grow in the skin, have been found on numerous specimens. In 2008, researchers discovered microscopic structures, called melanosomes, within fossilized feathers of an ancient bird. Different kinds of melanosomes create different colors in the feathers. \n\nFollowing this discovery in 2010, two teams of researchers reported finding melanosomes preserved in feathers of two, small, Chinese, non-avian dinosaurs -- Sinosauropteryx and Anchiornis. In the more comprehensive study of Anchiornis, in which 29 samples were analyzed from feathers all over the body of one specimen, revealed that this 155-million-year-old, feathered dinosaur, about the size of a chicken, possessed black-and-white stripped wings and a rusty brown crest of feathers along the top and back of its skull.","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwFCiRsdx3yzBLJCc9A_CTaY","position":22,"publishedAt":"2014-11-21T19:18:55.000Z","title":"What Color Were Extinct Dinosaurs?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bN7XTFlxPTI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bN7XTFlxPTI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bN7XTFlxPTI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bN7XTFlxPTI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bN7XTFlxPTI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"bN7XTFlxPTI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"bN7XTFlxPTI","videoPublishedAt":"2012-09-24T13:59:09.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/cLcOXmgrfxY2k3kN2xmfy39Afdc\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3RkNpUnNkeDN5ekJMSkNjOUFfQ1RhWS4yMUQyQTQzMjRDNzMyQTMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"The extinction of non-avian dinosaurs except birds at the end of the Cretaceous has intrigued paleontologists for more than a century. In the 1900s, numerous speculative hypotheses were proposed. One was that dinosaurs just got too big, but the largest dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus, lived long before the end of the Cretaceous. \n\nThen in 1980, Walter and Luis Alvarez discovered that a bed of marine clay in Italy, right at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, contained abnormally high levels of iridium, an element rare in rocks on the Earth's surface but more common in asteroids and comets. Thus, they argued that an asteroid, about 10 km across, impacted the Earth, generating massive tsunamis, with impact debris cutting off sunlight for months, stopping photosynthesis, and causing freezing temperatures. Chemical reactions in the atmosphere caused acid rain and long-term global warming, all of which extinguished non-avian dinosaurs. Rocks from an impact crater called Chicxulub, buried beneath the shore of the Yucatan Peninsula, were dated radioisotopically at 65 million years, right when the extinctions occurred, confirming an impact.\n\nHowever, at the same time, massive lava flows erupted across what is now southwest India. These layers of lava, called the Deccan Traps, are up to 2,400 m thick and cover an area as large as California. They represent the second largest episode of continental volcanism in the Earth's history. The eruptions occurred over a 500,000 year period spanning the end of the Cretaceous, and probably caused many of the same effects as the impact: reduced sunlight, acid rain, short-term cooling, long-term greenhouse warming.\n\nAlthough most scientists believe that the impact represented the final blow for non-avian dinosaurs, the fact that both events occurred when these dinosaurs went extinct suggests that both events, with their similar \"killing mechanisms,\" could well have played a role.","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwFCiRsdx3yzBLJCc9A_CTaY","position":23,"publishedAt":"2014-11-21T19:19:08.000Z","title":"How Did All Dinosaurs Except Birds Go Extinct?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mCKeogDioWE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mCKeogDioWE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mCKeogDioWE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mCKeogDioWE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mCKeogDioWE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"mCKeogDioWE"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"mCKeogDioWE","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-01T13:38:55.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/knOPk-qtS1CwtKZju7Di4IV8q4w\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3RkNpUnNkeDN5ekJMSkNjOUFfQ1RhWS42MTI4Njc2QjM1RjU1MjlG","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Learn about bioluminescence in this sing-along animation featuring three glow-in-the-dark creatures: the anglerfish, a Bermuda fireworm, and a blue-ringed octopus.\n\nOnly the top layer of the ocean gets a lot of sunlight. Many marine animals aren't in the dark, however, because they make their own light. Some animals, like the Bermuda fireworm, use a process called bioluminescence. Chemicals in their bodies mix together to produce \"cold light,\" 'which doesn't give off any heat. Some bioluminescent animals, like the anglerfish, get their glow from tiny microbes that live inside special light organs in their bodies.\n\nThe blue-ringed octopus uses fluorescence, another process that can cause things to glow. When disturbed, blue circular rings flash all over its body. Instead of making their own light, they can absorb and re-emit light from outside their bodies. \n\nThe Museum's special exhibition, \"Creatures of Light: Nature's Bioluminescence,\" is on display until January 6, 2013.

Most dinosaurs with sharp, bladed and serrated teeth, like steak knives, belong to the group of dinosaurs called theropods, such as Tyrannosaurus, Allosaurus, and Velociraptor, and most likely used their teeth to slash prey and slice meat. Other dinosaurs possessing sets of teeth that wore down into flat grinding surfaces as the animal chewed, such as Triceratops and duckbills, most likely used their teeth to grind or shred leaves, seeds, and other vegetation.\n\nOne can also look at the position of the jaw joint to get a general sense of an animal's diet. If the joint between the upper and lower jaws is at the same level as the tooth rows, as in modern cats and other carnivores, the animal was probably a meat-eater whose jaw muscles allowed the jaws to close with tremendous speed and precision, as was likely the case with Tyrannosaurus. However, if the jaw joint was lower than the tooth rows, such as in modern herbivores, the jaw muscles allowed the teeth in the upper and lower jaws to move back-and-forth or side-to-side across each other to grind or slice vegetation, as was likely the case in Triceratops and duckbills.\n\nAlthough it's often impossible to determine exactly what a specific kind of dinosaur ate, certain fossils occasionally provide clues. Some \"mummified\" duckbills preserve fossilized stomach contents in the ribcage, including conifer needles, twigs, seeds, and fruits. Some AMNH Coelophysis skeletons at reveal the bones of small crocodiles inside the ribcage that probably represent the animal's last meal. Also, coprolites (fossilized feces) can also provide clues to diet. Bone fragments in one coprolite associated with a skeleton of a Velociraptor-like dinosaur from Mongolia shows that it was eating small, lizard-sized animals.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

Usually, these traces consist of an organism's hard parts, such as bones, teeth, shells, or wood. Occasionally, when conditions are optimal, soft parts of organisms can also fossilize, such as impressions of skin, body outlines, and, more commonly, leaves. In almost all cases, fossils provide information about the original shape and structure of these physical traces; however, they usually do not provide any information about the original color of the body parts. Other traces of objects made by organisms, such as footprints, burrows, and nests, also qualify to be called fossils. Also, most definitions of fossils require that the organism's body part or other physical trace be more than 10,000 years old in order to truly be called a fossil.\n\nHowever, objects made by prehistoric humans, such as pottery, arrowheads and buildings, are not considered to be fossils, but instead are referred to as anthropological artifacts.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

Because many extinct, non-avian dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus and Apatosaurus, are so immense, it was generally assumed that they grew slowly and required 50-100 years to attain their great size. \n\nBut recent research involving microscopic analyses of the cellular structure of dinosaur bone has revolutionized our answers to these mysteries. Dinosaur bones contain growth rings, somewhat like the rings in tree trunks, which reveal yearly periods of rapid and slow growth. By studying growth rings in Tyrannosaurus bones, scientists can estimate how fast the animal was growing at different times in its life and how old individual animals were when they died. \n\nThese studies, done in conjunction with paleontologists at AMNH, document that that Tyrannosaurus, which attained a weight of more than 10,000 pounds as an adult, reached sexual maturity at about 20 years of age and lived for up to 28 years. In order to obtain its immense size and weight, it could put on almost five pounds a day during its phase of maximum growth. As one might expect, these rates of relative growth are fairly similar to those found in birds, which are the closest living relatives of Tyrannosaurus.Microscopic studies of these growth rings in Apatosaurus bones suggest that this sauropod's period of fastest growth occurred between about 7 and 13 years of age, when the animal gained about 32 pounds a day - or about 6 tons a year! Although paleontologists used to think that gigantic dinosaurs lived a century or so, based on studies of living reptiles like giant tortoises, growth rings show that their life span was probably a lot shorter, perhaps only 30-40 years.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

In birds, the only living group of dinosaurs, the scales are modified into feathers, except around the feet and beak. So, the hind feet of extinct dinosaurs probably looked like a bird's foot, but what about the rest of their body? \n\nRare, non-avian dinosaur \"mummies\" provide intriguing direct evidence. Impressions of dinosaur skin are only preserved under most extraordinary circumstances, for example, in an environment that is extremely dry or that lacks sufficient oxygen to support organisms that quickly decompose soft tissues. One of these is the AMNH Edmontosaurus \"mummy, one of the greatest dinosaur fossils ever collected. Impressions of skin are preserved over almost the entire body. The surface is covered by tubercles of varying size. Some are large and diamond-shaped; others are small and rounded. Around the base of the limbs, on the neck, and at other joints, the skin is folded, like that surrounding the joints of an elephant, presumably to allow flexibility during movement. The mummy's remarkable preservation is attributed to the notion that it lay unscavenged on the sandbar of an ancient stream for a short period, during which its skin dried out and its tendons and ligaments contracted, leaving the carcass in a contorted \"death pose.\" Shortly thereafter, a flood quickly buried it.\n\nAnother remarkable recent discovery in Patagonia reveals what the skin of some giant dinosaurs was like just before they hatched. Some of the fossilized eggs, about the size of a grapefruit, contained fossilized embryos of sauropods called titanosaurs, which were about 30-36 cm long, and patches of fossilized skin revealed that bumpy, scale-like plates, arranged in rows and rosettes, covered the embryos. The embryos were killed when a flood inundated their nesting site and buried the eggs.","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwFCiRsdx3yzBLJCc9A_CTaY","position":28,"publishedAt":"2014-11-21T19:27:52.000Z","title":"What Was Dinosaur Skin Like?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6i3EmBNYptk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6i3EmBNYptk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6i3EmBNYptk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6i3EmBNYptk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6i3EmBNYptk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"6i3EmBNYptk"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"6i3EmBNYptk","videoPublishedAt":"2012-09-17T15:37:29.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/zkDtGpt4T3vGJVe2KNGLdF-XM4Y\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3RkNpUnNkeDN5ekJMSkNjOUFfQ1RhWS45RjNFMDhGQ0Q2RkFCQTc1","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"African penguins are critically endangered, their colonies reduced by 70 percent in the last decade.
