Dozens of aerospace companies have emerged in recent years, all with the goal of commercializing space as never before. From serving NASA's cargo needs to sending tourists on space vacations to mining asteroids for profit, this next generation of entrepreneurs, and not NASA, may be the ones who transform space into our backyard, possibly creating the first-ever trillionaires.\n\nHost and moderator Neil deGrasse Tyson, who is the Frederick P. Rose Director of the Hayden Planetarium, lead the 2014 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate, Selling Space, with a panel of entrepreneurs and space historians on March . \n\nPanelists Include:\n\nWanda M. Austin, President and CEO of The Aerospace Corporation. Austin served on President Obama's Review of Human Spaceflight Plans Committee in 2009, and in 2010 she was appointed to the Defense Science Board.\n\nMichael Gold, Director of DC Operations and Business Growth, Bigelow Aerospace. Gold is also chairman of Commercial Space Transportation Advisory Committee, Federal Aviation Administration.\n\nJohn Logsdon, Professor Emeritus, Space Policy & International Affairs, George Washington University. Logsdon in a space policy analyst and historian.\n\nElliot Pulham, Chief Executive Officer, Space Foundation. The Space Foundation advocates for commercial, military, and government space interests.\n\nTom Shelley, President, Space Adventures, Ltd. Space Adventures provides opportunities for private spaceflight and space tourism.\n\nRobert Walker, Executive Chairman, Wexler & Walker Public Policy Associates. Walker served as chairman of the House Committee on Science and Technology from 1977 to 1997.\n\nThe late Dr. Isaac Asimov, one of the most prolific and influential authors of our time, was a dear friend and supporter of the American Museum of Natural History. In his memory, the Hayden Planetarium is honored to host the annual Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate\u2014generously endowed by relatives, friends, and admirers of Isaac Asimov and his work\u2014bringing the finest minds in the world to the Museum each year to debate pressing questions on the frontier of scientific discovery.

The script is written by award-winning science author Timothy Ferris. In addition to penning several best-selling books and consulting on space exploration policy for NASA, Ferris has another intriguing credit on his r\u00e9sum\u00e9\u2014in 1977 he produced the \"Golden Records\" carried by the two Voyager spacecraft on their journey through our solar system and beyond.\n\nVoyager 1 and 2 spent more than a decade exploring our planetary neighbors, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus and Neptune before turning towards interstellar space. On February 17, 1998, Voyager 1 became the most distant human-made object, and both spacecraft continue to send back data and in August 2012, Voyager I left our solar system. While it will be 40,000 years before they approach another planetary system, NASA believes the \"Golden Records\" may still be readable, able to \"communicate a story of our world to extraterrestrials.\"\n\nDARK UNIVERSE celebrates the pivotal discoveries that have led us to greater knowledge of the structure and history of the universe and our place in it\u2014and to new frontiers for exploration. The Space Show is narrated by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson and opens November 2, 2013, at the American Museum of Natural History.\n\nDARK UNIVERSE was created by the American Museum of Natural History, the Frederick Phineas and Sandra Priest Rose Center for Earth and Space, and the Hayden Planetarium.\n \nMade possible through the generous sponsorship of ACCENTURE.\n \nAnd proudly supported by CON EDISON.\n \nThe Museum also gratefully acknowledges major funding from the Charles Hayden Foundation.\n \nPresented with special thanks to NASA and the National Science Foundation.\n \nDARK UNIVERSE was developed by the American Museum of Natural History, New York (www.amnh.org),\nin collaboration with the California Academy of Sciences, San Francisco and GOTO INC, Tokyo, Japan.","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwG5sRg8FEVZRa8pOVQ8cUz_","position":2,"publishedAt":"2018-02-08T22:25:46.000Z","title":"Interview with Voyager's \"Golden Record\" Producer","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wD2P05_h8h4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wD2P05_h8h4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wD2P05_h8h4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wD2P05_h8h4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"wD2P05_h8h4"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"wD2P05_h8h4","videoPublishedAt":"2013-09-20T21:33:03.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/BxJeP1gGIlUbknovGU0diUreyHM\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3RzVzUmc4RkVWWlJhOHBPVlE4Y1V6Xy4wMTcyMDhGQUE4NTIzM0Y5","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"The Curiosity rover is seeking environments on Mars that could support life\u2014or could have in the past.

And in the early hours of August 6, 2012, humanity's latest effort to explore the Red Planet--the Curiosity Rover--safely touched down on the rocky landscape in a triumph of ingenuity and technology.  While previous space probes and rovers so far have revealed no canals, flying saucers, or little green men, there is evidence that millions of tons of liquid water once flowed on the planet's surface. Today, Mars is cold and dry, but there could still be liquid water underground\u2014raising the intriguing prospect of living organisms below the surface. \n\nPursuing that possibility is the mission of the aptly named Curiosity rover. An advanced mobile laboratory, Curiosity will not only be searching for evidence of past or present life on the planet but will also be collecting data to help determine the potential for its future habitability. The exhibition Beyond Planet Earth: The Future of Space Exploration, features a life-size model of the Curiosity rover, as well as a section examining how humans might one day make the journey to Mars in person. \n\nBeyond Planet Earth is on view at the American Museum of Natural History through August 12, 2012. \n\nFor more information, visit http:\/\/www.amnh.org\/beyond.\n\nBeyond Planet Earth: The Future of Space Exploration is organized by the American Museum of Natural History, New York (amnh.org), in collaboration with MadaTech: The Israel National Museum of Science, Technology & Space, Haifa Israel.\n\nBeyond Planet Earth is made possible through the sponsorship of \nLockheed Martin Corporation.\n\nAnd is proudly supported by Con Edison.\n\nMajor funding has been provided by\nThe Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Endowment Fund.\n\nAdditional support is generously provided by\nMarshall P. and Rachael C.

Falcon Heavy draws upon the proven heritage and reliability of Falcon 9. \n\nIts first stage is composed of three Falcon 9 nine-engine cores whose 27 Merlin engines together generate more than 5 million pounds of thrust at liftoff, equal to approximately eighteen 747 aircraft. Only the Saturn V moon rocket, last flown in 1973, delivered more payload to orbit. Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space and restores the possibility of flying missions with crew to the Moon or Mars.","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwG5sRg8FEVZRa8pOVQ8cUz_","position":5,"publishedAt":"2018-02-09T16:55:14.000Z","title":"Falcon Heavy Test Flight","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wbSwFU6tY1c\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wbSwFU6tY1c\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wbSwFU6tY1c\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wbSwFU6tY1c\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/wbSwFU6tY1c\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"wbSwFU6tY1c"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"wbSwFU6tY1c","videoPublishedAt":"2018-02-06T21:03:04.000Z"}}]}
