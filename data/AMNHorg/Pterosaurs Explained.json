They walked on their wings. Some were gigantic, while others could fit in the palm of a hand. Millions of years ago, the skies were ruled by pterosaurs, the first animals with backbones to fly under their own power. In the new exhibition Pterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs, rare fossils, life-size models, and hands-on interactives bring these ancient animals to life.\n\nStep back in time to see pterosaurs, including giants such as Tropeognathus mesembrinus,with a wingspan of more than 25 feet, and find out how they moved on land and in the air. Get a first-hand look at the rare pterosaur fossils that have helped paleontologists learn all that we know about these animals. In a virtual flight lab, use your body to pilot a pterosaur over a prehistoric landscape. Encounter the exceptional creatures that flew in the age of dinosaurs. \n\nPterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs is on view from April 5, 2014, through January 4, 2015.

There are competing theories, chief among them that crests serve as a form of species identification. Other possibilities include a role in sexual selection, heat regulation, as a rudder in flight, or as a keel in the water, stabilizing the reptile as it dove or skimmed for food. \n\nWithout living descendants for comparison and because pterosaur fossils are so rare, it's impossible to say for sure. Researchers would have to find thousands more fossils in different growth stages to answer the question. \n\nPterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs is on view from April 5, 2014, through January 4, 2015.

Even the word \"pterosaur\" (TER-o-soar) can trip up readers with its silent \"p\" (the word originates from the Greek pteron, for wing, and sauros, for lizard). Now, you can brush up on tongue-twisting pterosaur genus names, from Jeholopterus to Quetzalcoatlus, with a pronunciation guide featuring students from the Museum's education programs.\n\nPterosaurs are named according to a set of rules called the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature, with scientific names including the genus and species. The first person to describe a pterosaur assigns the animal its name, which is often derived from Greek or Latin words or references the place where the specimen was collected or unusual anatomical characteristics. The species Quetzalcoatlus northropi, discovered in southwestern Texas, was named after Quetzalcoatl, a Mexican god of the air, and the industrialist Jack Northrop, known for developing a stealth aircraft called the flying wing.\n\nPterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs is on view from April 5, 2014, through January 4, 2015.

As pterosaurs' arm and hand bones evolved for flying, they lengthened, and the bones of one finger\u2014the equivalent of our ring finger\u2014became extraordinarily long. Like the mast on a ship, these bones supported the wing surface, a thin flap of skin that was shaped like a sail.\n\nAlthough many animals can glide through the air, pterosaurs, birds and bats are the only vertebrates that have evolved to fly by flapping their wings. All three groups descended from animals that lived on the ground, and their wings evolved in a similar way: their forelimbs gradually became long, bladelike and aerodynamic. \n\nAlthough they have much in common, pterosaurs, birds and bats developed the ability to fly independently. Their wings evolved along different paths, and the difference can be seen in their structure.\n\nPterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs is on view from April 5, 2014, through January 4, 2015.

And yet, discovering bones that have been buried for millions of years is just one aspect of their job. \n\nPaleontology has traditionally combined a number of disciplines, including earth history, geology and biology. Many paleontologists today spend more hours in computer labs than they do in the field. Michael Habib, a neurobiology professor at the University of Southern California who consulted on the exhibition, applies principles of engineering and biology to understand how pterosaurs might have flown and behaved. \n\nPterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs is on view from April 5, 2014, through January 4, 2015.
