Carpenter, entomologist and curator in the Museum's Division of Invertebrate Zoology. The Museum's Hymenoptera collection includes more than 1,200 paper nests made by social wasps, as well as the 7.5 million-specimen gall wasp collection donated to the Museum in 1958 by the widow of Alfred C. Kinsey.\r\n\r\nThe primary focus of Dr. Carpenter's work is the wasp family Vespidae, a group of nearly 5,000 described species that encompasses the most sophisticated societies among the social wasps, i.e., ones that build large, communal nests.  (Gall wasps, by contrast, are solitary; they lay their eggs, fly away, and never have contact with their offspring again.) Carpenter's special concentration is on the commonly known yellowjackets and hornets.\r\n\r\nThe Hymenoptera are a large order of insects that includes bees, wasps and ants. The group features more than 115,000 described species, as much as 10% of the described species diversity of the planet. Economically and ecologically, Hymenoptera are one of the most important groups of taxa.\r\n\r\nProduced\/edited by Jill Bauerle.

Fossil preparation involves cutting open the plaster jacket and removing this matrix surrounding the fossil.\n\nThe matrix may be soft and crumbly when the sand or mud is poorly cemented together, or it can be extremely hard when the sediments are well-cemented. Accordingly, a wide variety of tools is required to remove the matrix and stabilize the fossil. Commonly, dental tools are used to carefully pick away\nsediment near the bone, along with custom-made needles composed of carbide steel.\n\nPreparators carefully select the materials used to strengthen or repair specimens. Adhesives, glues, and fillers must stand the test of time and not become brittle or discolored, just like the materials used to conserve works of art. The types of materials used are recorded in order to aid future preparators if further preparation or repair is required.\n\nWatch as Justy Alicea, a senior preparator at the American Museum of Natural History, works on a specimen and then gives a tour of the Museum's fossil preparation lab.\n\nFor more information visit http:\/\/www.amnh.org\n\nProduced\/edited by James Sims","playlistId":"PL23609C1422FCA903","position":11,"publishedAt":"2008-10-28T14:07:01.000Z","title":"Preparing Dinosaur Fossils Inside AMNH","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u-4BXU--G9s\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u-4BXU--G9s\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u-4BXU--G9s\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u-4BXU--G9s\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u-4BXU--G9s\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"u-4BXU--G9s"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"u-4BXU--G9s","videoPublishedAt":"2011-03-02T21:30:04.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/PEqlUig-p9eANcO-3JK3lvqKKKI\"","id":"UEwyMzYwOUMxNDIyRkNBOTAzLkI1QkFCQ0U4NEM1NDE3NUQ=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"The American Museum of Natural History houses the largest collection of bird specimens in the world.

Part of this effect can be credited to Sugimoto's talent as a photographer, but the effect wouldn't be possible without the skill of the Museum's diorama artists, who blended science and nature to create the illusion of reality. Using the latest technology, they constructed the foreground, taxidermy, and painted background of a diorama to reflect that of the original site.\n\nNot lost on Sugimoto is the fact that when Museum preparators made collecting trips to diorama sites, they documented the area with photographs, which they referred to when they went back to the Museum and brought the dioramas to life.\n\n\"Now I'm re-photographing the diorama, based on the photography,\" the artist said. \"So many layers of transformation--that's very conceptually interesting.\"  \n\nDuring a 2012 shoot of the Olympic Forest diorama in the Hall of North American Forests, Sugimoto explained why he keeps coming back to the Museum.\n\n\"I have my ideas and visions of what nature should look like. So I'm using this diorama to represent my idealistic visions of nature.\" \n\nKnown as \"Windows on Nature,\" the Museum's habitat dioramas are recognized internationally as premier examples of the fusion of art and science. The lifelike displays were created to educate the public about nature and science and also engender feelings of wonder for the natural world. \n\nFor his latest round of photographs, the artist used his trademark 8 x 10 large-format camera to explore the theme of lost nature, or what the earth would look like if human civilization vanished.  \n\nThe first photographs from the \"Dioramas\" series, shot in 1976, brought Sugimoto to acclaim. \"Dioramas\" continues to gain an audience today with recent exhibitions at the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles and the Pace Gallery in New York.\n\n\nDioramas seen in this video (in order of appearance):","playlistId":"PL23609C1422FCA903","position":19,"publishedAt":"2014-06-04T14:28:55.000Z","title":"Hiroshi Sugimoto: Four Decades of Photographing Dioramas","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q9GiyPbLYPg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q9GiyPbLYPg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q9GiyPbLYPg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q9GiyPbLYPg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/q9GiyPbLYPg\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"q9GiyPbLYPg"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"q9GiyPbLYPg","videoPublishedAt":"2014-06-04T14:27:03.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/UhgVV70UQrv2wCAlrk5FbIeOL-U\"","id":"UEwyMzYwOUMxNDIyRkNBOTAzLjI1NzBGMUUxNjk0QTE4OTE=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"In the late 1960s, Curator Emeritus Niles Eldredge was a graduate student with a passion for trilobite eyes. He had been taught to expect slow and steady change between the specimens of these Devonian arthropods he collected for his dissertation. Only his trilobites were doing one of two things: staying the same, or evolving in leaps.\n\nSeveral years later, Eldredge, along with co-author Stephen Jay Gould,  turned his observations into a theory known as \u201cpunctuated equilibria\u201d: the idea that species stay relatively the same, or at equilibrium, throughout the fossil record save for rare bursts of evolutionary change.\n\nA former Chairman and Curator of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, Eldredge remains at the hub of evolutionary discussion and debate, as well as one of the world's experts on trilobites, specializing in mid-Paleozoic phacopids. He has also analyzed the relationship between global extinctions of the geologic past and the present-day biodiversity crisis, as well as the general relationship between extinction and evolution. \n\nLearn more about Trilobites: http:\/\/www.amnh.org\/our-research\/paleontology\/faq\/trilobite-website\n\nVIDEO CREDITS:\n\nVIDEO:\nAMNH\/J.
