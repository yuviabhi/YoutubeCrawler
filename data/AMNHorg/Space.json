Recently, a team of researchers led by the American Museum of Natural History used a suite of high-tech instrumentation and software called Project 1640 (www.amnh.org\/project1640) to collect the first chemical fingerprints, or spectra, of the four red exoplanets orbiting this star. This visualization also shows other stars that are known to harbor planetary systems (stars with blue circles around them). HR 8799's system, which is 128 light years away from Earth, is one of only a couple of these stars that have been imaged, and the only one for which spectroscopy of all the planets has been obtained. Over the next three years, the team will survey many of these other stars in the same manner in which they studied HR 8799.\n\nMusic by Gurdonark (http:\/\/ccmixter.org\/files\/gurdonark\/20064)\nusing Creative Commons Attribution samples by Kaer Trouz and the Institute of Contemporary Music","playlistId":"PL820A688B24E9247E","position":7,"publishedAt":"2013-03-11T18:21:06.000Z","title":"Remote Reconnaissance of Another Solar System","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yDNAk0bwLrU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yDNAk0bwLrU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yDNAk0bwLrU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yDNAk0bwLrU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/yDNAk0bwLrU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"yDNAk0bwLrU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"yDNAk0bwLrU","videoPublishedAt":"2013-03-11T17:46:05.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/8QGsJSIP-amX9i4OrYXT-gkFn3Q\"","id":"UEw4MjBBNjg4QjI0RTkyNDdFLkRGQzFBMUQzNURFODkzQkE=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"For centuries, the possibility of life on Mars has sparked curiosity from observers on Earth. And in the early hours of August 6, 2012, humanity's latest effort to explore the Red Planet--the Curiosity Rover--safely touched down on the rocky landscape in a triumph of ingenuity and technology.  While previous space probes and rovers so far have revealed no canals, flying saucers, or little green men, there is evidence that millions of tons of liquid water once flowed on the planet's surface. Today, Mars is cold and dry, but there could still be liquid water underground\u2014raising the intriguing prospect of living organisms below the surface. \n\nPursuing that possibility is the mission of the aptly named Curiosity rover. An advanced mobile laboratory, Curiosity will not only be searching for evidence of past or present life on the planet but will also be collecting data to help determine the potential for its future habitability. The exhibition Beyond Planet Earth: The Future of Space Exploration, features a life-size model of the Curiosity rover, as well as a section examining how humans might one day make the journey to Mars in person. \n\nBeyond Planet Earth is on view at the American Museum of Natural History through August 12, 2012. \n\nFor more information, visit http:\/\/www.amnh.org\/beyond.\n\nBeyond Planet Earth: The Future of Space Exploration is organized by the American Museum of Natural History, New York (amnh.org), in collaboration with MadaTech: The Israel National Museum of Science, Technology & Space, Haifa Israel.\n\nBeyond Planet Earth is made possible through the sponsorship of \nLockheed Martin Corporation.\n\nAnd is proudly supported by Con Edison.\n\nMajor funding has been provided by\nThe Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Endowment Fund.\n\nAdditional support is generously provided by\nMarshall P. and Rachael C.

Should we proceed straight to Mars, should we return to the Moon, or should multiple destinations be the goal? Central to the debate are thorny issues that relate to science, launch hardware, international competition, national security, shrinking budgets, and political will.

Tyson appears as a character in the recent DC Comics' ACTION COMICS #14, \"Star Light, Star Bright.\" In real life, he consulted a star index and found a real star that supported the backstory of the comic. \n\nThe red dwarf star designated for having the ability to support a Krypton-like planet is located in the constellation Corvus 27.1 light years from Earth. The star, designated LHS 2520, possesses a red, highly turbulent surface, somewhat cooler and smaller than the Sun. To find it in the night's sky, amateur astronomers and Superman fans can follow these coordinates: \n\nJ2000\nRight Ascension: 12 hours 10 minutes 5.77 seconds\nDeclination:  -15 degrees 4 minutes 17.9 seconds\nProper Motion: 0.76 arcseconds per year, along 172.94 degrees from due north\n\nDr. Tyson has a well-documented history applying science to entertainment in order to make the subject accessible and exciting to the public. He is the Director of Hayden Planetarium at the American Museum of Natural History, which since its founding in 1935 has served as the premier conduit between the frontier of cosmic discovery and the public's appreciation of it.  Tyson also recently made headlines by getting film director, James Cameron, to alter the night's sky as seen in The Titanic due to inaccuracies. The adjustment was made and can be seen in the re-release of Titanic 3-D.\n\nTyson noted, \"As a native of Metropolis, I was delighted to help Superman, who has done so much for my city over all these years.  And it's clear that if he weren't a superhero he would have made quite an astrophysicist.\"\n\nFor more information about ACTION COMICS #14, visit http:\/\/www.dccomics.com\/\n\nCREDITS:\n\nMUSIC:\n\"Fat Cats\" by Watzmann\nhttp:\/\/ccmixter.org\/files\/Watzmann\/38330\n\nIMAGES\nAMNH\/Brian Abbott\nMichelet B.\nIztok Boncina\/ESO\nTorsten Bronger\nDC Comics\nNASA\n\nVIDEO\nAMNH\/J.

This icy world is one of thousands of rocky bodies that make up the Kuiper Belt, a ring that circles our solar system beyond Neptune. Until recently, the most powerful telescopes on Earth and in space could only capture blurry impressions of Pluto and its moons. But in 2015, New Horizons became the first spacecraft to visit the Pluto system, returning detailed images and data that will bring our distant neighbor\u2019s surface, atmosphere, and internal composition into focus for the first time.\n\nExplore the natural world with Science Bulletins, science news videos and data visualizations from the American Museum of Natural History that cover recent discoveries in astrophysics, Earth science, biodiversity, and human health and evolution.\n\nWant more Science Bulletins?

This is perhaps the most fundamental question in all of science, and it may also be the most controversial.\n\n Albert Einstein was among the first to envision a unified theory that could account for the behavior of all matter and energy in the cosmos, but a definitive solution has eluded physicists to this day. As the 21st century progresses, \"string theory\" remains the leading candidate to be the \"theory of everything\"\u2014although some have come to question whether string theorists are on the right track. Still others doubt that a \"theory of everything\" exists at all\u2014and consider the search for such a theory an outdated philosophy of our search for cosmic truths.\n\n Join Director of the Hayden Planetarium Neil deGrasse Tyson as he hosts and moderates six of the world's leading voices in this great scientific debate.\n\nPanelists:\n\nDr. Katherine Freese, professor of physics at the University of Michigan\n\nDr. Jim Gates, professor of physics at the University of Maryland-College Park\n\nDr. Janna Levin, professor of physics and astronomy at Barnard College\n\nDr. Marcello Gleiser, professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College\n\nDr. Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University\n\nDr. Lee Smolin, theoretical physicist at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics\n\nThe talk was recorded at the American Museum of Natural History on March 7, 2011.\n\n2017 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: De-Extinction\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_LnAtMeSVeY&index=1&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2016 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Is the Universe a Simulation? \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wgSZA3NPpBs&index=2&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2015 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Water, Water \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FSF79uS3t04&index=3&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2014 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Selling Space \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GbmFeEIKBFI&index=4&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2013 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: The Existence of Nothing \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1OLz6uUuMp8&index=5&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2012 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Faster Than the Speed of Light \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5qlLW60wOjo&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ&index=6\n\n2011 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: The Theory of Everything \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Eb8_3BUHcuw&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ&index=7\n\nRose Center Anniversary Isaac Asimov Debate: Is Earth Unique? \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9Ji_GdAk9vU&index=8&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ&t=25s\n\n***\nSubscribe to our channel: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/subscription_center?add_user=AMNHorg\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/AMNHorg\n\nFacebook: http:\/\/fb.com\/naturalhistory \nTwitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/amnh\nTumblr: http:\/\/amnhnyc.tumblr.com\/\nInstagram: http:\/\/instagram.com\/amnh","playlistId":"PL820A688B24E9247E","position":42,"publishedAt":"2016-11-23T20:37:23.000Z","title":"2011 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: The Theory of Everything","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Eb8_3BUHcuw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Eb8_3BUHcuw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Eb8_3BUHcuw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"Eb8_3BUHcuw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"Eb8_3BUHcuw","videoPublishedAt":"2016-11-23T20:55:38.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/siqEOu_hEMIsnvHpTuak_zDUJmc\"","id":"UEw4MjBBNjg4QjI0RTkyNDdFLjcwMDRDQjc1QzY2QzE1Mjg=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"TRAPPIST-1\u2019s planets are much closer together than the planets of our solar system.
