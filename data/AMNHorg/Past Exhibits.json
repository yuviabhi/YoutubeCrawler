They walked on their wings. Some were gigantic, while others could fit in the palm of a hand. Millions of years ago, the skies were ruled by pterosaurs, the first animals with backbones to fly under their own power. In the new exhibition Pterosaurs: Flight in the Age of Dinosaurs, rare fossils, life-size models, and hands-on interactives bring these ancient animals to life.\n\nStep back in time to see pterosaurs, including giants such as Tropeognathus mesembrinus,with a wingspan of more than 25 feet, and find out how they moved on land and in the air. Get a first-hand look at the rare pterosaur fossils that have helped paleontologists learn all that we know about these animals. In a virtual flight lab, use your body to pilot a pterosaur over a prehistoric landscape.

We require it; we crave it; we sometimes obsess over it. Food connects us to our environment, to the world around us, and to each other, like nothing else.\n\nThe new exhibition \"Our Global Kitchen: Food, Nature, Culture\" explores the complex human food web and examines the history, science, and culture of what we eat and how. In the coming years, reshaping the world's food system to sustainably feed a growing population will be an immense and global project. \n\n\"Our Global Kitchen: Food, Nature, Culture\" opens at the American Museum of Natural History on Saturday, November 17.\n\nFor more information, visit:\nhttp:\/\/www.amnh.org\/calendar\/our-global-kitchen-food-nature-culture\n\nThe exclusive corporate sponsor for \"Our Global Kitchen\" is \nJ.P.

Curator John Sparks, marine biologist David Gruber, and firefly expert Marc Branham discuss what's most surprising about bioluminescence, what it takes to produce a scientifically accurate model of a bioluminescent animal, and how to re-create the experience of scuba diving on a magnificent coral wall.\r\n\r\nCreatures of Light (March 31, 2012 - January 6, 2013) introduces visitors to the astonishing variety of bioluminescent organisms and explores the various ways they glow, the functions of bioluminescence, and how scientists study this remarkable characteristic. \r\n\r\nThe exhibition unfolds through a series of immersive environments, beginning in a forest of bioluminescent mushrooms and taking visitors through a meadow filled with fireflies, a bioluminescent bay in Puerto Rico, coral reefs, and the deep sea to highlight the ways in which different animals use bioluminescence to attract mates and prey, and to threaten predators. Along the way, see live flashlight fish and special equipment, including a scale model of a deep-sea submersible.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about the exhibition, visit amnh.org\r\n\r\nCreatures of Light: Nature's Bioluminescence is organized by the\r\nAmerican Museum of Natural History, New York,\r\nin collaboration with the Canadian Museum of Nature, Ottawa, Canada,\r\nand The Field Museum, Chicago.\r\n\r\nGenerous support for Creatures of Light has been provided by \r\nthe Eileen P.

Not quite. Exhibition staff and scientists at the American Museum of Natural History toast the completion of the new exhibition, Extreme Mammals: the Biggest, Smallest and Most Amazing Mammals of All Time from inside a re-creation of the extinct Indricotherium, the largest land mammal ever to walk Earth.\r\n\r\nIf you think youve seen this pose before, well, its true. The toast recalls a New Years Eve dinner of 1853, hosted by renowned English paleontologist Richard Owen, inside a life-size model of an Iguanodon. The Iguanodon and models of other dinosaurs species known at the time were the work of sculptor Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, working from drawings by Owen, and destined for the new site of the Crystal Palace in Sydenham, UK. The celebrated dinner was reported in the Illustrated London News and Punch, among others.","playlistId":"PL1A8FCC1E0123058B","position":20,"publishedAt":"2012-06-26T20:18:06.000Z","title":"An extreme toast... to Extreme Mammals at AMNH","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3Dc3bHsjtZI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3Dc3bHsjtZI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3Dc3bHsjtZI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"3Dc3bHsjtZI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"3Dc3bHsjtZI","videoPublishedAt":"2009-05-15T01:34:42.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/3G5kxKBht5WBOkOySD7Gnkwzyeg\"","id":"UEwxQThGQ0MxRTAxMjMwNThCLkZFNDQzQjQ0Q0NCNjIyNDQ=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"","playlistId":"PL1A8FCC1E0123058B","position":21,"publishedAt":"2013-09-10T14:13:43.000Z","title":"John Flynn on Extreme Mammals South America","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ATZkCf2dD2c\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ATZkCf2dD2c\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ATZkCf2dD2c\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"ATZkCf2dD2c"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"ATZkCf2dD2c","videoPublishedAt":"2013-09-10T14:12:54.000Z"}}]}
