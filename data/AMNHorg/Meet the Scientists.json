Dr. Kim is particularly interested in understanding the origin of the first photosynthetic eukaryotes.

His research has focused on systematic and functional anatomical investigations of the groups concerned. Dr. MacPhee also studies recent mammalian extinctions (last 40,000 years). Loss of species during geologically recent times is a worldwide phenomenon that has been blamed either on direct impacts involving people, or less direct impacts caused by environmental change. His research aims to clarify the causal patterns behind these losses, most recently by studying population dynamics of fossil species using ancient DNA methods.\n\nFor more interviews, visit our \"Meet the Scientists\" channel:\nhttp:\/\/www.amnh.org\/explore\/amnh-tv\/(category)\/1325","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwF-NyC34X2zVb3jQiLZFsXe","position":31,"publishedAt":"2013-02-27T15:38:24.000Z","title":"Profile: Ross MacPhee","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ZjwpO_RjKXU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ZjwpO_RjKXU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ZjwpO_RjKXU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ZjwpO_RjKXU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ZjwpO_RjKXU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"ZjwpO_RjKXU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"ZjwpO_RjKXU","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-26T13:32:52.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/FE_YGcsxR9OW8GEGNveU_dwuWlM\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3Ri1OeUMzNFgyelZiM2pRaUxaRnNYZS41QTY1Q0UxMTVCODczNThE","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Trained as a geologist specializing in mineralogy and crystallography, Dr. George Harlow has concentrated his research on the chemistry and structure of minerals as tools for understanding their origin and the record of geological processes they contain.

He analyzes important new \"feathered\" dinosaurs from Liaoning, China, and develops theoretical methods for better understanding phylogenetic relationships and pattern in the fossil record. Under his co-direction with Michael Novacek, a team working in the Gobi desert since 1990 has produced a wealth of great specimens. Dr. Norell's theoretical work focuses on developing methodology for evaluating the effect of missing data on large data sets, sensitivity methods for character weighting, and using phylogeny to estimate patterns in the fossil record such as diversity and extinction.\n\nFor more interviews, visit our \"Meet the Scientists\" channel:\nhttp:\/\/www.amnh.org\/explore\/amnh-tv\/(category)\/1325","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwF-NyC34X2zVb3jQiLZFsXe","position":43,"publishedAt":"2013-02-27T15:38:24.000Z","title":"Profile: Mark Norell","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ipwyE56bRkA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ipwyE56bRkA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ipwyE56bRkA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ipwyE56bRkA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/ipwyE56bRkA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"ipwyE56bRkA"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"ipwyE56bRkA","videoPublishedAt":"2012-08-01T13:24:25.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/DeUUDMIt9fsJdxJa8GyHbL_ANGk\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3Ri1OeUMzNFgyelZiM2pRaUxaRnNYZS5CMEQ2Mjk5NTc3NDZFRUNB","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Through Dr. Rozen's worldwide research on the biology, immature stages, and evolutionary relationships of bees (Hymenoptera: Apoidea), the AMNH houses what is believed to be the most complete collection of bee eggs, larvae, and pupae.

Korea's transformation into the ranks of the newly industrial countries has inspired Dr. Kendall to take a second look at Korean shamans, the subject of her initial 1970s fieldwork. By interpreting what people do during contemporary shamanic rituals and what clients, shamans, and spirits speaking through shamans have to say about them, she documents how Koreans' use of offerings and ritual props lets them express and dramatize the tangled emotions inherent in a lived history of rapid social transformation and unprecedented material possibility.\n\nFor more interviews, visit our \"Meet the Scientists\" channel:\nhttp:\/\/www.amnh.org\/explore\/amnh-tv\/(category)\/1325","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwF-NyC34X2zVb3jQiLZFsXe","position":45,"publishedAt":"2013-02-27T15:38:24.000Z","title":"Profile: Laurel Kendall","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1C3q95UANgA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1C3q95UANgA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1C3q95UANgA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1C3q95UANgA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/1C3q95UANgA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"1C3q95UANgA"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"1C3q95UANgA","videoPublishedAt":"2012-08-03T13:34:23.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/LHhA1M1Je7wkhWyI8eTFWGzTCmE\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3Ri1OeUMzNFgyelZiM2pRaUxaRnNYZS40QTA3NTU2RkM1QzlCMzYx","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Dr. David Grimaldi's research is broadly concerned with the evolution of insects, from species-level diversity in drosophilid fruit flies to the phylogeny of orders over the past 400 million years.  The research relies on fieldwork collecting recent species and excavating new deposits, exploratory morphology, study of insect fossils, and phylogenetics.  A major research project at present includes the relation between the radiations of insects and angiosperms in the Cretaceous.  Another major project is on a diverse deposit of Triassic insects from Virginia, the only such deposit in the Western Hemisphere.  Ongoing research explores the diversity and biogeography of a Miocene community preserved in amber from Hispaniola.\n\nFor more interviews, visit our \"Meet the Scientists\" channel:\nhttp:\/\/www.amnh.org\/explore\/amnh-tv\/(category)\/1325","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwF-NyC34X2zVb3jQiLZFsXe","position":46,"publishedAt":"2013-02-27T15:38:24.000Z","title":"Profile: David Grimaldi","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/chiaCchpia8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/chiaCchpia8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/chiaCchpia8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/chiaCchpia8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/chiaCchpia8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"chiaCchpia8"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"chiaCchpia8","videoPublishedAt":"2012-08-29T11:22:08.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/OnIt9xgJ6aiBdKY_IhV47Ub4miA\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3Ri1OeUMzNFgyelZiM2pRaUxaRnNYZS5BRjJDODk5REM0NjkzMUIy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Rob DeSalle works in molecular systematics, microbial evolution and genomics.

Dr DeSalle has worked closely with colleagues from Cold Spring Harbor Labs, New York University and the New York Botanical Garden on seed plant genomics and development of tools to establish gene family membership on a genome wide scale. His group also focuses on microbial genomics, taxonomy and systematics. In particular, they approach tree of life questions concerning microbial life using whole genome information.
