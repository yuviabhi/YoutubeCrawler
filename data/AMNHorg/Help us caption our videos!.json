The discussion, before a sold-out crowd in the Museum's LeFrak Theater, was moderated by Dr. Sanjay Gupta, chief medical correspondent for CNN.  The event was also live-streamed on amnh.org to a digital audience of several hundred viewers around the country.\n\nKnown for such landmark discoveries as \"Lucy\" (Johanson) and \"Turkana Boy\" (Leakey), the work of these two scientists has produced much of the fossil evidence that forms our understanding of human evolution.\n\nLooking back over careers spanning 40-plus years, Dr. Johanson and Dr. Leakey shared the stories behind their monumental finds and offered a look at what's ahead in human evolutionary research.\n\nThis historic event was made possible through a joint partnership of the American Museum of Natural History, the Arizona State University Institute of Human Origins, and the Turkana Basin Institute, headquartered in the U.S. at Stony Brook University.\n\nThis video is a recording of the live stream, which ran at http:\/\/www.amnh.org\/live\n\nProduced and directed by James Sims.
