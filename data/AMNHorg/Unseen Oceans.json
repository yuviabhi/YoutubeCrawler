The research shows that biofluorescence\u2014a phenomenon by which organisms absorb light, transform it, and eject it as a different color\u2014is common and variable among marine fish species, indicating its potential use in communication and mating. The report opens the door for the discovery of new fluorescent proteins that could be used in biomedical research.\n \nWhile conducting their research, the team embarked on high-tech expeditions to tropical waters. The most recent expedition was The Explore21 Solomon Islands Expedition, the first trip under a new Museum initiative that supports exploratory fieldwork that is multidisciplinary and heavily integrated with emerging technologies. From the research vessel Alucia the scientists conducted technical scuba dives and descended in a three-person submersible to examine deep coral reef biofluorescence down to 1,000 meters. They also submitted the scientific paper while aboard.\n \nTo learn more about this study, visit amnh.org.\n \n\nMUSIC\n\"Snowball by Moby\n\"Secret Garden\" by Paul Wheatley\/\nWarner Chappell Production Music\n\nSOUND EFFECTS\ncarroll27\nmelissapons\n\nANIMATION\nAMNH\/Department of Exhibition\nWayne Decatur\nMovie S1 from Chen Y, Tsai M, Yang T, Ku A, Huang K, Huang C, \nChou F, Fan H, Hong J, Yen S, Wang W, Lin C, Hsu Y, Su K, Su I, Jang C, \nBehringer R, Favaro R, Nicolis S, Chien C, Lin S, Yu I (2012)\nMovie S1 from Yu H, Serebryannyy L, Fry M, Greene M, Chernaya O, Hu W, Chew T, Mahmud N, Kadkol S, Glover S, Prins G, Strakova Z, de Lanerolle P (2013)\nVideo S4 from Egawa R, Hososhima S, Hou X, Katow H, Ishizuka T, Nakamura H, Yawo H (2013)\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nKen Corben\nDavid Gruber\nJim Hellemn\nDawn Roje\nRobert Schelly\nJohn Sparks\n\nVIDEO\nAMNH\/J.

But recent encounters between humpback whales and bottlenose dolphins reveal a playful side to interspecies interaction. In two different locations in Hawaii, scientists watched as dolphins \"rode\" the heads of whales: the whales lifted the dolphins up and out of the water, and then the dolphins slid back down. The two species seemed to cooperate in the activity, and neither displayed signs of aggression or distress. Whales and dolphins in Hawaiian waters often interact, but playful social activity such as this is extremely rare between species. The latest Bio Bulletin from the Museum's Science Bulletins program presents the first recorded examples of this type of behavior. Visitors to AMNH may view the video in the Hall of Biodiversity until February 9, 2012. \r\n\r\nScience Bulletins is a production of the National Center for Science Literacy, Education, and Technology (NCSLET), part of the Department of Education at the American Museum of Natural History.

Others look like alien brains. But in their skeletons are clues that promise to give scientists a detailed picture of the weather from 500 years ago. Reading these bones? Easy. As long as you have the world's most powerful X-ray laser.\n\nDEEP LOOK: a new ultra-HD (4K) short video series created by KQED San Francisco and presented by PBS Digital Studios. See the unseen at the very edge of our visible world. Get a new perspective on our place in the universe and meet extraordinary new friends. Explore big scientific mysteries by going incredibly small.\n\nIs coral a plant or animal?\n\nCorals are unusual creatures. They are actually a partnership- or symbiosis- between an animal (a polyp) and a plant (algae) in which they work together to survive and thrive.\n\nHow does coral grow?\n\nTiny animals called polyps form an exoskeleton to live in. When one polyp dies, another builds a new home right on top of the old one. Beneath lies the abandoned exoskeletons, like an ancient city made of layer upon layer of old dwellings.\n\nWhat is coral made of?\n\nCoral exoskeletons are mostly made of calcium carbonate. But sometimes the polyps incorporate tiny amounts of other elements from the surrounding water, including the element strontium. Biologists don\u2019t fully understand why polyps absorb strontium, but it\u2019s a phenomenon that happens consistently across the world\u2019s oceans.\n\nWhen sea surface temperatures are warmer, corals absorb less strontium into their exoskeletons. When they are colder, they absorb more. By comparing the strontium-to-calcium ratio over time, scientists are able to reconstruct sea surface temperatures from the past. They also can chart long-term climate cycles that occurred over the lifespan of the coral. Since these corals can live for over 500 years, this gives us insights into the weather hundreds of years before written scientific records. \n\nRead the article for this video on KQED Science:\nhttp:\/\/ww2.kqed.org\/science\/2015\/07\/07\/what-happens-when-you-zap-coral-with-the-worlds-most-powerful-x-ray-laser\/\n--\n\nMore great Deep Look episodes:\n\nWhere Are the Ants Carrying All Those Leaves? \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=-6oKJ5FGk24\n\nWhat Happens When You Put a Hummingbird in a Wind Tunnel?\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=JyqY64ovjfY\n\nPygmy Seahorses: Masters of Camouflage \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Q3CtGoqz3ww\n\nSee also another great video from the PBS Digital Studios!\n\nIt\u2019s Okay to Be Smart: The Oldest Living Things In The World\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=jgspUYDwnzQ\n\nMore KQED Science:\n\nTumblr:  http:\/\/kqedscience.tumblr.com\nTwitter: https:\/\/www.twitter.com\/kqedscience\nKQED Science: http:\/\/ww2.kqed.org\/science\n\nFunding for Deep Look is provided in part by PBS Digital Studios and the John S. and James L.
