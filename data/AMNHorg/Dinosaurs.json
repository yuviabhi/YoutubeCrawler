A new study led by scientists at the American Museum of Natural History gives a multifaceted answer.\n \nThe findings, published online on May 1, 2012, in the journal Nature Communications, suggest that in general, large-bodied, \"bulk-feeding\" herbivores were declining during the last 12 million years of the Cretaceous. But carnivorous dinosaurs and mid-sized herbivores were not.\n \n\"Few issues in the history of paleontology have fueled as much research and popular fascination as the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs,\" says lead author Steve Brusatte, a Columbia University graduate student affiliated with the Museum's Division of Paleontology. \"Did sudden volcanic eruptions or an asteroid impact strike down dinosaurs during theirprime? We found that it was probably much more complex than that, and maybe not the sudden catastrophe that is often portrayed.\"\n \nThe research team, which includes Brusatte; Mark Norell, chair of the Museum's Division of Paleontology; and scientists Richard Butler of Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich and Albert Prieto-M\u00e1rquez from the Bavarian State Collection for Palaeontology, both in Germany, is the first to look at dinosaur extinction based on \"morphological disparity\"\u2014the variability of body structure within particular groups of dinosaurs.\n\nFor more information, read the Museum's press release about this new research: http:\/\/www.amnh.org\/science\/papers\/extinction_2012.php","playlistId":"PL9D4E862ED2468E9C","position":1,"publishedAt":"2012-05-03T19:25:05.000Z","title":"Were Dinosaurs Undergoing Long-Term Decline Before Mass Extinction?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cgGnvH0Ozvk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cgGnvH0Ozvk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cgGnvH0Ozvk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cgGnvH0Ozvk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/cgGnvH0Ozvk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"cgGnvH0Ozvk"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"cgGnvH0Ozvk","videoPublishedAt":"2012-05-01T15:00:05.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/L2JSLCZ7-cMxr3pKKCRlVqoUk8k\"","id":"UEw5RDRFODYyRUQyNDY4RTlDLkRFRjZBNjQxQUMzMTZGMDg=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"On March 9, the American Museum of Natural History and io9 hosted a live webcast discussion about new dinosaur feather research.

By comparing the patterns of pigment-containing organelles from a Microraptor fossil to those in modern birds, the scientists determined that the dinosaur's plumage was iridescent with hues of black and blue like the feathers of a crow. Their results were published by the journal Science in March.\r\n\r\n\"This study gives us an unprecedented glimpse at what this animal looked like when it was alive,\" said Mark Norell, one of the paper's authors and chair of the Museum's Division of Paleontology.\r\n\r\nAlthough its anatomy is very similar to birds, Mircroraptor is considered a non-avian dinosaur and is placed in the family of \"running lizards\" like Velociraptor. Knowledge about Microraptor's plumage could help scientists zero in on the evolutionary transition from non-avian dinosaurs to birds.\r\n\r\nThe research also shows that Microraptor's tail fan, which was once thought to be a broad, teardrop-shaped surface meant to help with flight, is actually much narrower with two protruding feathers likely evolved for social interactions. This new finding suggests the importance of display in the early evolution of feathers.","playlistId":"PL9D4E862ED2468E9C","position":3,"publishedAt":"2012-05-03T19:26:54.000Z","title":"New Dinosaur Research: Microraptor's Feather Color Revealed","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XJGiPzcalwU\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XJGiPzcalwU\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XJGiPzcalwU\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XJGiPzcalwU\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/XJGiPzcalwU\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"XJGiPzcalwU"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"XJGiPzcalwU","videoPublishedAt":"2012-03-08T19:00:00.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/l49f4eIgZ7-QB706f9sCBWoWUvU\"","id":"UEw5RDRFODYyRUQyNDY4RTlDLkE5NTJFQTgzMUVCODhFNUI=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"There's new evidence that dinosaurs, once thought to resemble scaly lizards, were in fact fluffy, colorful animals.

Fossil preparation involves cutting open the plaster jacket and removing this matrix surrounding the fossil.\n\nThe matrix may be soft and crumbly when the sand or mud is poorly cemented together, or it can be extremely hard when the sediments are well-cemented. Accordingly, a wide variety of tools is required to remove the matrix and stabilize the fossil. Commonly, dental tools are used to carefully pick away\nsediment near the bone, along with custom-made needles composed of carbide steel.\n\nPreparators carefully select the materials used to strengthen or repair specimens. Adhesives, glues, and fillers must stand the test of time and not become brittle or discolored, just like the materials used to conserve works of art. The types of materials used are recorded in order to aid future preparators if further preparation or repair is required.\n\nWatch as Justy Alicea, a senior preparator at the American Museum of Natural History, works on a specimen and then gives a tour of the Museum's fossil preparation lab.\n\nFor more information visit http:\/\/www.amnh.org\n\nProduced\/edited by James Sims","playlistId":"PL9D4E862ED2468E9C","position":7,"publishedAt":"2011-03-02T21:44:15.000Z","title":"Preparing Dinosaur Fossils Inside AMNH","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u-4BXU--G9s\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u-4BXU--G9s\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u-4BXU--G9s\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u-4BXU--G9s\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/u-4BXU--G9s\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"u-4BXU--G9s"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"u-4BXU--G9s","videoPublishedAt":"2011-03-02T21:30:04.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/-FprB7vFC4SiaJMttnhaFd6Re68\"","id":"UEw5RDRFODYyRUQyNDY4RTlDLkFFNTRCOUI3ODVFNEFGN0E=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"The American Museum of Natural History began the process of separating two long-time combatants -- barosaurus and allosaurus skeletons -- that have shared the same display mount in the Theodore Roosevelt Rotunda since they were first installed in 1991.

But microscopic imaging of bone structure published in PLoS One shows that this famously feathered fossil grew much slower than living birds and more like non-avian dinosaurs.\r\n\r\n\"For a long time, Archaeopteryx was considered the archetypical bird primarily because it had feathers, although it retained typical dinosaur features like a long tail and teeth,\" said Norell.  \"But the discovery of classical bird features like feathers and wishbones have recently been found in many non-avian dinosaurs blurring the line of what constitutes a bird.\"\r\n\r\nProduced\/Edited by James Sims.
