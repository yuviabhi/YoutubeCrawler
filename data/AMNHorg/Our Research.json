Niarchos Expedition to Sudan. Over the course of two weeks, the team traveled some 2,000 kilometers and visited about 20 archaeological sites dating from the ancient kingdom of Mero\u00eb. \n\nMero\u00eb was an independent kingdom of Nubia, centered in the north of Sudan and contemporaneous with Greek and Roman domination of the Mediterranean world. While Meroites were influenced by their Egyptian neighbors, they had a distinct political state, writing system, and religion. Archaeologists have only been able to translate a few Meroitic texts, so researchers must use other clues from the past to learn about this ancient civilization. \n\nOne of the 2011 Niarchos expedition's main goals was to document depictions of animals at archaeological sites. The animal representations they detailed in the field\u2014ranging from elephants to frogs\u2014will be compiled with images from artifacts in existing museum collections to create a \"bestiary\" for Mero\u00eb. This bestiary will be an organized catalog of animals, giving insight into how different species were used and ultimately leading to further research questions about religion, environment, and other subjects. \n\nThe expedition team also investigated other topics, including paleoanthropology, board games, and zootherapy\u2014the use of animals in medicine.  \n\nThis 2011 Constantine S.

The research shows that biofluorescence\u2014a phenomenon by which organisms absorb light, transform it, and eject it as a different color\u2014is common and variable among marine fish species, indicating its potential use in communication and mating. The report opens the door for the discovery of new fluorescent proteins that could be used in biomedical research.\n \nWhile conducting their research, the team embarked on high-tech expeditions to tropical waters. The most recent expedition was The Explore21 Solomon Islands Expedition, the first trip under a new Museum initiative that supports exploratory fieldwork that is multidisciplinary and heavily integrated with emerging technologies. From the research vessel Alucia the scientists conducted technical scuba dives and descended in a three-person submersible to examine deep coral reef biofluorescence down to 1,000 meters.

Dr. Raxworthy and his team travelled to the Seychelles and the Mascarene Islands, where they scoured lush canyons, rocky shores, and steep cliff sides in search of chameleons, geckos, and skinks.\n\nAt one time, these islands were home to the world's richest diversity of oceanic island reptile fauna. But with the arrival of humans several centuries ago, deforestation and other environmental degradation decimated reptile populations. Raxworthy hoped to rediscover lizards known only from bone material and specimens collected in the 19th and early 20th century. \n\nWhile the team found no evidence of those particular species, their survey of both island systems provided valuable data about the distribution of other endemic and introduced reptiles.  The information Raxworthy collected is helping researchers learn more about what happens in an ecosystem after extinction, how reptile communities are built, and the best ways to implement future conservation efforts. \n\nChristopher Raxworthy's Constantine S.

Harlow embarked on a Constantine S. Niarchos Expedition to the Montagua Valley in central Guatemala, a fault zone rich in the precious mineral, jadeite jade. Dr. Harlow and his team of geologists hiked along riverbeds and steep outcrops, collecting rock samples that might provide clues to the evolution of the Caribbean region.\n\nThe Caribbean originated 120 million years ago, when areas of volcanic islands and ocean floor squeezed past Mexico and South America. In what's known as the Guatemala suture zone, the boundary between the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates, geologists have found remnants of both a plate collision and a subduction zone, where an oceanic plate plunged into Earth's mantle. The high pressures of subduction zones help form minerals like jadeite and its host rock, serpentinite. By following the trail of jade in this region, Dr. Harlow and his team are gaining an understanding of the subduction and collisions that occurred throughout the history of Caribbean plate tectonics. \n\nDuring the expedition, the team studied an ophiolite--a piece of sea floor crust emplaced on top of the continent that had not previously been recorded on geological maps. Back at the Museum, Dr. Harlow's team, including Dr. Kennet Flores, a Davis Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, is conducting geochemical studies of the rock samples gathered during the expedition. Dr. Harlow anticipates that the results will provide insight into the geological puzzle of Guatemala and open windows for research in other parts of the world. \n\nGeorge Harlow's Constantine S. Niarchos Expedition was generously supported by the Stavros Niarchos Foundation.  \n\nThe research described in this video has been supported in part by the National Science Foundation (NSF) under grant numbers EAR0309116 and EAR1119403.\n\nVIDEO CREDITS:\n\nMUSIC\n\"Dazed\" by Airtone\n\nILLUSTRATIONS AND MAPS\nAMNH\/E.

A new study led by scientists at the American Museum of Natural History gives a multifaceted answer.\n \nThe findings, published online on May 1, 2012, in the journal Nature Communications, suggest that in general, large-bodied, \"bulk-feeding\" herbivores were declining during the last 12 million years of the Cretaceous. But carnivorous dinosaurs and mid-sized herbivores were not.\n \n\"Few issues in the history of paleontology have fueled as much research and popular fascination as the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs,\" says lead author Steve Brusatte, a Columbia University graduate student affiliated with the Museum's Division of Paleontology. \"Did sudden volcanic eruptions or an asteroid impact strike down dinosaurs during theirprime?

By comparing the patterns of pigment-containing organelles from a Microraptor fossil to those in modern birds, the scientists determined that the dinosaur's plumage was iridescent with hues of black and blue like the feathers of a crow. Their results were published by the journal Science in March.\r\n\r\n\"This study gives us an unprecedented glimpse at what this animal looked like when it was alive,\" said Mark Norell, one of the paper's authors and chair of the Museum's Division of Paleontology.\r\n\r\nAlthough its anatomy is very similar to birds, Mircroraptor is considered a non-avian dinosaur and is placed in the family of \"running lizards\" like Velociraptor. Knowledge about Microraptor's plumage could help scientists zero in on the evolutionary transition from non-avian dinosaurs to birds.\r\n\r\nThe research also shows that Microraptor's tail fan, which was once thought to be a broad, teardrop-shaped surface meant to help with flight, is actually much narrower with two protruding feathers likely evolved for social interactions.

Their trip would ultimately last five and a half years yielding significant zoological and anthropological findings for the museum.  \r\n\r\nExactly 100 years later another museum scientist, Dr. Mark Siddall, embarked on an expedition to the neighboring Rwanda.  As a curator of invertebrate zoology he travelled to Rwanda in search of leeches -- an animal that Lang and Chapin brought back amongst their original findings.  Siddall's research focuses on various aspects of leeches including the compound allowing them to stop blood from clotting and their DNA.  In total he collected five distinct species of leeches on this latest trip.\r\n\r\nWatch as Siddall traverses Rwanda's rugged landscape and interacts with the local population in search of the curious blood sucking creatures.\r\n\r\nProduced\/Edited by James Sims for AMNH.org.","playlistId":"PL3A812DA6E1AB9DDB","position":20,"publishedAt":"2012-07-25T14:59:17.000Z","title":"Finding Leeches in Rwanda w\/ Mark Siddall - AMNH","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A7cLHWSM_yY\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A7cLHWSM_yY\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A7cLHWSM_yY\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A7cLHWSM_yY\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/A7cLHWSM_yY\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"A7cLHWSM_yY"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"A7cLHWSM_yY","videoPublishedAt":"2009-08-31T17:35:28.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/it0SIiVaZbcOCFW9ce3ALgpmL1E\"","id":"UEwzQTgxMkRBNkUxQUI5RERCLjYxMjlFOTM3NkRGMTVCNzA=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Central Africa's roiling, rapid Lower Congo River is home to an extraordinary assortment of fish\u2014many truly bizarre.
