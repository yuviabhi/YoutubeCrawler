These marine arthropods existed for almost 300 million years, and over 20,000 species have been described so far. In this video, Museum Curator Neil Landman and Field Associates Andy Secher and Martin Shugar discuss trilobites, their unique features, and how fossils are collected and prepared while highlighting a new Museum exhibit that features 15 rare and beautiful trilobite fossils from the Museum's collection. \n\nAncient trilobite fossils are now on display in the Museum's Grand Gallery. The exhibit is made possible thanks to Martin Shugar, M.D., and Andy Secher.\n\nThis video and all media incorporated herein (including text, images, and audio) are the property of the American Museum of Natural History or its licensors, all rights reserved.

He had been taught to expect slow and steady change between the specimens of these Devonian arthropods he collected for his dissertation. Only his trilobites were doing one of two things: staying the same, or evolving in leaps.\n\nSeveral years later, Eldredge, along with co-author Stephen Jay Gould,  turned his observations into a theory known as \u201cpunctuated equilibria\u201d: the idea that species stay relatively the same, or at equilibrium, throughout the fossil record save for rare bursts of evolutionary change.\n\nA former Chairman and Curator of Paleontology at the American Museum of Natural History, Eldredge remains at the hub of evolutionary discussion and debate, as well as one of the world's experts on trilobites, specializing in mid-Paleozoic phacopids. He has also analyzed the relationship between global extinctions of the geologic past and the present-day biodiversity crisis, as well as the general relationship between extinction and evolution. \n\nLearn more about Trilobites: http:\/\/www.amnh.org\/our-research\/paleontology\/faq\/trilobite-website\n\nVIDEO CREDITS:\n\nVIDEO:\nAMNH\/J.
