The specimen had to be both scientifically accurate and beautiful, true not just to the Pinta Island species but to the beloved individual, Lonesome George. With no contemporary giant tortoise taxidermy to reference and no margin for error, this was a once-in-a-lifetime challenge.\n\nAs the process unfolded, Lonesome George\u2019s preparators developed an emotional connection to the animal. They also felt a deep responsibility to Lonesome George\u2019s former caretakers, to the people of Ecuador, and to future generations who might be inspired by Lonesome George\u2019s story and message of biodiversity under threat.\n\nThe short (24 mins) documentary \"Preserving Lonesome George,\" reveals the intricacies of taxidermy, in which art and science combine to create a powerful tribute to a global conservation icon.\n\nLearn more about Lonesome George: http:\/\/www.amnh.org\/explore\/preserving-lonesome-george\n\nLonesome George was on view at the Museum from Sept. 9, 2014 through January 4, 2015. Learn more about the exhibition: http:\/\/www.amnh.org\/exhibitions\/past-exhibitions\/lonesome-george\n\nIn 2015, Lonesome George will return to Ecuador as part of that nation\u2019s patrimony.\n\nThe special exhibition \"Lonesome George\" was presented at the American Museum of Natural History in collaboration with the Galapagos National Park Directorate and Galapagos Conservancy.\n\n\n\nVIDEO CREDITS:\n\nPresented by the American Museum of Natural History\n\nFEATURING (IN ORDER OF APPEARANCE)\nLonesome George \nEleanor Sterling\nLinda Cayot\nJames Gibbs\nMichael Novacek\nGeorge Dante\nChristopher Raxworthy\nDarrel Frost\nJohannah Barry\nArturo Izurieta\n\nPRODUCERS\nJill Bauerle\nLee Stevens\n\nEXECUTIVE PRODUCER\nEugenia Levenson\n\nCAMERA\nJill Bauerle\nErin Chapman\nLee Stevens\n\nOPENING TITLE SEQUENCE\nDESIGN AND DIGITAL COMPOSITOR\nAlberto Lude\u00f1a\n\nADDITIONAL FOOTAGE\nGalapagosDigital.com\/Miguel Alvear\nGeorge Lewis\n\nIMAGES\nAmerican Association \nof Zoological Parks \nand Aquariums\nAMNH\/Craig Chesek\nAMNH\/Denis Finnin\nAMNH\/Roderick Mickens\nAMNH Library Archives\nEmanuel Bowen\nGisella Caccone\nLinda Cayot\nGeorge Dante\nGalapagos Conservancy\nGalapagos National Park Directorate\nTom Fritts\nEric Gaba\nPeter Gene\nJames Gibbs\nZachary Grinspan\nOle Hamann\nDavid Adam Kess\nLeslie Lenny\nAlizon Llerena\nMaryEllen and Paul\nDaniel Mietchen\nNever Lamb\n\u00a9 Pete Oxford\/Corbis\nRoelant Savery\nSir Peter Scott\nTimothy Snell\/testmeat.com\nIgor Starukha\nTriiiple Threat\nUnited States Geological Survey\nMike Weston\nPeter Wilton\n\n\nMUSIC\n\"Step By Step Underscore\"\nComposed by Ben Stone\nWarner\/Chappell Production Music\n\n\"Early Fog Lifter\"\nComposed by Ken Lewis, Scott Dente, and Matt Stanfield\nWarner\/Chappell Production Music\n\n\"Indigo\"\nComposed by Guillermo De La Berreda, \nTomas Jacobi, and Nicholas Berry\nWarner\/Chappell Production Music\n\n\"Away from Earth\"\nComposed by Gijs van Amelsvoort \nWarner\/Chappell Production Music\n\n\"The Broken Places\"\nComposed and Performed by Moby\nCourtesy of Moby\n\n\"Limpopo\"\nComposed by Tom Fox\nWarner\/Chappell Production Music\n\n\"A Freak\"\nComposed and Performed by Moby\nCourtesy of Moby\n\n\"Later Alligator\"\nComposed by Roger Dexter\nWarner\/Chappell Production Music\n\n\"Story Underscore\"\nComposed by G.
