This is perhaps the most fundamental question in all of science, and it may also be the most controversial.\n\n Albert Einstein was among the first to envision a unified theory that could account for the behavior of all matter and energy in the cosmos, but a definitive solution has eluded physicists to this day. As the 21st century progresses, \"string theory\" remains the leading candidate to be the \"theory of everything\"\u2014although some have come to question whether string theorists are on the right track. Still others doubt that a \"theory of everything\" exists at all\u2014and consider the search for such a theory an outdated philosophy of our search for cosmic truths.\n\n Join Director of the Hayden Planetarium Neil deGrasse Tyson as he hosts and moderates six of the world's leading voices in this great scientific debate.\n\nPanelists:\n\nDr. Katherine Freese, professor of physics at the University of Michigan\n\nDr. Jim Gates, professor of physics at the University of Maryland-College Park\n\nDr. Janna Levin, professor of physics and astronomy at Barnard College\n\nDr. Marcello Gleiser, professor of physics and astronomy at Dartmouth College\n\nDr. Brian Greene, professor of physics and mathematics at Columbia University\n\nDr. Lee Smolin, theoretical physicist at Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics\n\nThe talk was recorded at the American Museum of Natural History on March 7, 2011.\n\n2017 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: De-Extinction\nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=_LnAtMeSVeY&index=1&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2016 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Is the Universe a Simulation? \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=wgSZA3NPpBs&index=2&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2015 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Water, Water \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FSF79uS3t04&index=3&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2014 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Selling Space \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=GbmFeEIKBFI&index=4&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2013 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: The Existence of Nothing \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=1OLz6uUuMp8&index=5&t=25s&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ\n\n2012 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: Faster Than the Speed of Light \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=5qlLW60wOjo&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ&index=6\n\n2011 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: The Theory of Everything \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=Eb8_3BUHcuw&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ&index=7\n\nRose Center Anniversary Isaac Asimov Debate: Is Earth Unique? \nhttps:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=9Ji_GdAk9vU&index=8&list=PLrfcruGtplwGKzxDI_Ne06NlpOKt-yonZ&t=25s\n\n***\nSubscribe to our channel: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/subscription_center?add_user=AMNHorg\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/AMNHorg\n\nFacebook: http:\/\/fb.com\/naturalhistory \nTwitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/amnh\nTumblr: http:\/\/amnhnyc.tumblr.com\/\nInstagram: http:\/\/instagram.com\/amnh","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwGpUhsZBpBOYxpYH8clOJNY","position":0,"publishedAt":"2018-02-08T19:40:42.000Z","title":"2011 Isaac Asimov Memorial Debate: The Theory of Everything","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Eb8_3BUHcuw\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Eb8_3BUHcuw\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Eb8_3BUHcuw\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"Eb8_3BUHcuw"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"Eb8_3BUHcuw","videoPublishedAt":"2016-11-23T20:55:38.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/aZhdxiXloUSj8gurfVwffvE1_2I\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3R3BVaHNaQnBCT1l4cFlIOGNsT0pOWS4yODlGNEE0NkRGMEEzMEQy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"When black holes collide, the energy of the event generates intense gravitational waves. These waves were predicted by Einstein in his theories, but scientists have only recently been able to detect them experimentally. In this SciCafe, Barnard College professor and astronomer Janna Levin shares her scientific research on the first recordings of a gravitational wave from the collision of two black holes 1.3 billion years ago.\n\nThis lecture took place at the Museum on December 7, 2016.
