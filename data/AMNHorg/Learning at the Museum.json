Asked to replicate a dinosaur but not told its species, students worked with a collection of Allosaurus fossils from the Museum's Paleontology collection to scan, digitally model, and print the bones using 3D printers. They were then challenged to identify the dinosaur and construct a skeletal model from the printed bones. For reference, the class explored the Museum's fourth-floor dinosaur halls, studying mounted specimens of Tyrannosaurus rex and Apatosaurus as they tried to determine their dinosaur's species.\n\nTo help students better understand how paleontologists work, museum scientists and staff led behind-the-scenes tours of the Museum's Big Bone Room, Fossil Preparation Lab, and the Division of Paleontology's Fossil Reptiles Collections. Students also got a first-hand look at the scanning technologies used by Museum researchers, including a computed tomography (CT) scanner and a scanning electron microscope. \n\nThe \"Capturing Dinosaurs\" program was developed by the Museum's Education department with the Richard Gilder Graduate School and the Division of Paleontology, in collaboration with the educational services cooperative HTINK and the 3D printer manufacturer, MakerBot. \n\nLearn more about youth programs offered at the Museum: http:\/\/www.amnh.org\/learn-teach\n\n***\nSubscribe to our channel: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/subscription_center?add_user=AMNHorg\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/AMNHorg\n\nFacebook: http:\/\/fb.com\/naturalhistory \nTwitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/amnh\nTumblr: http:\/\/amnhnyc.tumblr.com\/\nInstagram: http:\/\/instagram.com\/amnh\n\n***","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwEd85UHvX0D7c2gTc9gB368","position":7,"publishedAt":"2013-08-05T15:59:49.000Z","title":"Students Use 3D Printing to Reconstruct Dinosaurs","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_KBxG1_WO8k\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_KBxG1_WO8k\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_KBxG1_WO8k\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_KBxG1_WO8k\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/_KBxG1_WO8k\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"_KBxG1_WO8k"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"_KBxG1_WO8k","videoPublishedAt":"2013-08-05T15:49:20.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/cfCDewmGJdYQGeyFyCokIEIp8CY\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3RWQ4NVVIdlgwRDdjMmdUYzlnQjM2OC4wOTA3OTZBNzVEMTUzOTMy","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"A group high school students got the opportunity to use cutting-edge digital tools to carry out their own small-scale investigation of evolutionary relationships between mammals in a program called \"Morpholution\" during the Museum's Digital Learning Week in January.\n\nLed by Museum scientists and educators, students learned how to navigate Morphobank, a web application used by researchers to record and analyze traits of various species\u2014including, just recently, for a major study by Museum scientists and colleagues that traced the ancestor of placental mammals, which was published in the journal \"Science\" in February.

As they entered their findings into Morphobank, they learned how scientists document and communicate evolutionary data, then generated evolutionary trees based on the data they had collected during the day.\n\n***\nSubscribe to our channel: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/subscription_center?add_user=AMNHorg\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/AMNHorg\n\nFacebook: http:\/\/fb.com\/naturalhistory \nTwitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/amnh\nTumblr: http:\/\/amnhnyc.tumblr.com\/\nInstagram: http:\/\/instagram.com\/amnh\n\n***","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwEd85UHvX0D7c2gTc9gB368","position":8,"publishedAt":"2013-04-04T16:05:46.000Z","title":"Digital Learning Week 2013: Morpholution","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/v20Qx3Pu2pI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/v20Qx3Pu2pI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/v20Qx3Pu2pI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/v20Qx3Pu2pI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/v20Qx3Pu2pI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"v20Qx3Pu2pI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"v20Qx3Pu2pI","videoPublishedAt":"2013-04-04T16:05:33.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/fCQ6mZ5xht0AdoNO_aZ4q_j9Euw\"","id":"UExyZmNydUd0cGx3RWQ4NVVIdlgwRDdjMmdUYzlnQjM2OC5GNjNDRDREMDQxOThCMDQ2","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"The extinction of the Neanderthals nearly 30,000 years ago during the last ice age is one of the great puzzles of human evolution\u2014and one that middle school students can tackle with the help of 3-D digital animation in a Museum program this summer.\n\nDuring the two-week\u00a0Virtual Worlds Institute: What Happened to the Neanderthals?,\u00a0students work with Museum scientists and educators to gather fossil, cultural, and genetic evidence from Museum collections and exhibits, then reconstruct a virtual Neanderthal world using software that depicts a photo-realistic ice-age Europe and brings\u00a0Homo neanderthalensis\u00a0back to life.\u00a0\n\nBy the end of the course, the students develop their own hypotheses about Neanderthal extinction and present their virtual worlds\u00a0to friends, family, and Museum scientists.\u00a0\n\nThe next Virtual Worlds Institute: What Happened to the Neanderthals? for incoming 6th-, 7th-, and 8th-grade students takes place from July 8-19, 2013.\n\nVisit amnh.org to learn more about the course and how to apply: http:\/\/www.amnh.org\/learn-teach\/families\/adventures-in-science\/virtual-worlds-institute-what-happened-to-the-neanderthals-grades-6-8\n\nVideo Credits:\n\nMUSIC\n\"Globalization\" by radiotimes\nhttp:\/\/ccmixter.org\/files\/radiotimes\/14356\n\n\"My Supergirl\" by johnnok\nhttp:\/\/ccmixter.org\/files\/johnnok\/2848\n\n\"Plunktrack (ft. pitx, duckett)\" by teru\nhttp:\/\/ccmixter.org\/files\/teru\/16584\n\nPHOTOGRAPHY\nAMNH\/M.

Futter, President of the American Museum of Natural History. \"The Museum's new Master of Arts in Teaching program extends the Museum's formal roles both in improving the teaching of science and addressing the national crisis in science education, and will be an important new component of the Museum's longstanding graduate training, including, most notably, the Richard Gilder Graduate School, the only museum-based Ph.D.-granting program in the country.\"\n \nDrawing on the Museum's unique resources and long history in teacher professional development, the 15-month MAT program is being launched as part of a specialized pilot program to help address a critical shortage of qualified science teachers in New York State, particularly in high-needs schools, by offering coursework with a specialization in Earth science for teachers of grades 7 through 12.  The MAT program, which is supported by funding provided in part by the New York State Education Department and the National Science Foundation, will model and test new approaches that can be replicated across New York State and nationally. \n \nThe Museum  will conduct the program in partnership with six schools\u2014Murry Bergtraum High School for Business Careers in Manhattan; the Queens Vocational and Technical High School in Queens; the Thomas C.  Giordano Middle School in the Bronx; Roosevelt High School and Gorton High School in Yonkers; and Freeport High School in Freeport, Long Island\u2014with diverse student populations that include English Language Learners and students with special needs. Candidates in the MAT program will spend a full academic year in a partner school and will receive mentoring from experienced science teachers. In a feature unique to the Museum's program, degree candidates will also spend two summers paired with Museum scientists and educators, one summer in programs for youth and one summer in a science practicum  residency.\n \nIn addition, alumni of the Museum's program will be offered a  two-year, early-career professional development program, a critical  element of support for new teachers entering the classroom that directly addresses the high rates of attrition among new teachers and the specific challenges of teaching in high-needs schools.\n \nThe Museum will begin the planning process for the new MAT program this fall, with the first class of teachers slated to begin coursework next summer.\n \nThe new MAT program continues to build on the Museum's work in post-secondary education. In 2006, the Museum became the first museum in the Western Hemisphere to grant the Ph.D. through its Richard Gilder Graduate School, which offers a doctoral program in comparative biology.\n\n***\nSubscribe to our channel: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/subscription_center?add_user=AMNHorg\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/AMNHorg\n\nFacebook: http:\/\/fb.com\/naturalhistory \nTwitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/amnh\nTumblr: http:\/\/amnhnyc.tumblr.com\/\nInstagram: http:\/\/instagram.com\/amnh\n\n***","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwEd85UHvX0D7c2gTc9gB368","position":14,"publishedAt":"2013-02-27T15:46:32.000Z","title":"Museum Launches Master of Arts in Teaching Program","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/41yQjYQRgkc\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/41yQjYQRgkc\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/41yQjYQRgkc\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/41yQjYQRgkc\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/41yQjYQRgkc\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"41yQjYQRgkc"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"41yQjYQRgkc","videoPublishedAt":"2011-08-23T16:23:26.000Z"}}]}
