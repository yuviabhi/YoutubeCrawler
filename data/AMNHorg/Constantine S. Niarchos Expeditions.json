The nocturnal primates often show up in local, regional, and international trade as pets and for traditional medicine.\n\nMary Blair, Director of Biodiversity Informatics Research at the Museum\u2019s Center for Biodiversity and Conservation, co-directs a project that aims to gather essential population data for the Bengal slow loris and the Pygmy slow loris.\n\nThe researchers\u2019 work includes forest surveys where they encounter the animals while walking on trails or transects at night, and gathering data from slow loris collections in museums around the world. Blair and her colleagues also collaborate with Vietnamese authorities to help identify confiscated species.\n\nThe project is jointly organized by the Museum and the Center for Natural Resources and Environmental Studies at Vietnam National University, Hanoi. The ultimate goal is to help conservation managers more effectively protect these species from further decline.\n\nFunding for this study was provided by the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation at the American Museum of Natural History, National Science Foundation (CHE-1313908), the Margot Marsh Biodiversity Foundation, the Eppley Foundation for Research, the Disney Worldwide Conservation Fund, and the USAID PEER Science Program (3-149).  \n\nAny opinions, findings, and conclusions or recommendations expressed in this material are those of the author(s) and do not necessarily reflect the views of the National Science Foundation.\n\nLearn more about wildlife trade research at the Center for Biodiversity and Conservation: http:\/\/www.amnh.org\/our-research\/center-for-biodiversity-conservation\/research-and-conservation\/species-based-research\/mammals\/wildlife-trade-in-vietnam\n\nVIDEO CREDITS:\n\nProducer:\nJill Bauerle\n\nExecutive Producer:\nEugenia Levenson\n\nVideo:\nAMNH\/J.

But first, they had to bare their arms and legs and attract bloodsucking leeches.\n\nFollow the 2015 Constantine S. Niarchos Expedition to Cambodia, led by leech expert Mark Siddall, curator in the Museum\u2019s Division of Invertebrate Zoology. A trio of scientists trek through the forests of Cambodia in search of Haemadipsida\u2014a family of jawed, terrestrial jungle leeches that feed on the blood of mammals.\n\nWhile the main purpose of the trip was to document leech biodiversity in Southeast Asia, the expedition was designed to sample \u201cbycatch\u201d as well\u2014namely, DNA from the blood of these leeches mammalian meals, which can be preserved in a leeches\u2019 gut for months.  \n\nBack at the Museum, that DNA was sequenced and fed into a database that identifies biological sequences. Matching these strings of sequenced DNA to existing samples let researchers identify which animals the leeches were feeding on\u2014other than humans, whose status as a leech meal the whole team could attest to. These \u201cIDNA\u201d tests provide conservation biologists with a valuable snapshot of species living in a specific area. \n\nTracking elusive, endangered mammals in their native habitats can be difficult and time-consuming work involving the use of sophisticated technology like radio tagging and camera traps. However in recent years, the IDNA method of sequencing the contents of leeches\u2019 stomachs has provided a faster, less expensive alternative to other methods of mammal-spotting.\n\n\u201cWhat we're able to do is go in, go to a forest just for a day, collect leeches off the ground, collect them off of ourselves, sequence the DNA from their gut contents, and use that DNA to figure out what mammals are in an area, very efficiently.\u201d said expedition member Michael Tessler, a Ph.D.-degree student at the Museum\u2019s Richard Gilder Graduate School. Data from Tessler\u2019s labwork on the DNA gathered from leech guts will form the basis of his dissertation. \n\nThe results of the Niarchos expedition to Cambodia could also help conservation biologists refine the leech gut IDNA method by setting benchmarks for the number of leech species and number of individual leeches to collect when using the method in a given area.\n\nVIDEO CREDITS:\n\nVIDEO:\nAMNH\/J.

Niarchos Expedition to Sudan. Over the course of two weeks, the team traveled some 2,000 kilometers and visited about 20 archaeological sites dating from the ancient kingdom of Mero\u00eb. \n\nMero\u00eb was an independent kingdom of Nubia, centered in the north of Sudan and contemporaneous with Greek and Roman domination of the Mediterranean world. While Meroites were influenced by their Egyptian neighbors, they had a distinct political state, writing system, and religion. Archaeologists have only been able to translate a few Meroitic texts, so researchers must use other clues from the past to learn about this ancient civilization. \n\nOne of the 2011 Niarchos expedition's main goals was to document depictions of animals at archaeological sites. The animal representations they detailed in the field\u2014ranging from elephants to frogs\u2014will be compiled with images from artifacts in existing museum collections to create a \"bestiary\" for Mero\u00eb. This bestiary will be an organized catalog of animals, giving insight into how different species were used and ultimately leading to further research questions about religion, environment, and other subjects. \n\nThe expedition team also investigated other topics, including paleoanthropology, board games, and zootherapy\u2014the use of animals in medicine.  \n\nThis 2011 Constantine S.

Harlow embarked on a Constantine S. Niarchos Expedition to the Montagua Valley in central Guatemala, a fault zone rich in the precious mineral, jadeite jade. Dr. Harlow and his team of geologists hiked along riverbeds and steep outcrops, collecting rock samples that might provide clues to the evolution of the Caribbean region.\n\nThe Caribbean originated 120 million years ago, when areas of volcanic islands and ocean floor squeezed past Mexico and South America. In what's known as the Guatemala suture zone, the boundary between the North American and Caribbean tectonic plates, geologists have found remnants of both a plate collision and a subduction zone, where an oceanic plate plunged into Earth's mantle. The high pressures of subduction zones help form minerals like jadeite and its host rock, serpentinite. By following the trail of jade in this region, Dr. Harlow and his team are gaining an understanding of the subduction and collisions that occurred throughout the history of Caribbean plate tectonics. \n\nDuring the expedition, the team studied an ophiolite--a piece of sea floor crust emplaced on top of the continent that had not previously been recorded on geological maps. Back at the Museum, Dr. Harlow's team, including Dr. Kennet Flores, a Davis Postdoctoral Scholar in the Department of Earth and Planetary Sciences, is conducting geochemical studies of the rock samples gathered during the expedition. Dr. Harlow anticipates that the results will provide insight into the geological puzzle of Guatemala and open windows for research in other parts of the world. \n\nGeorge Harlow's Constantine S.

Dr. Raxworthy and his team travelled to the Seychelles and the Mascarene Islands, where they scoured lush canyons, rocky shores, and steep cliff sides in search of chameleons, geckos, and skinks.\n\nAt one time, these islands were home to the world's richest diversity of oceanic island reptile fauna. But with the arrival of humans several centuries ago, deforestation and other environmental degradation decimated reptile populations. Raxworthy hoped to rediscover lizards known only from bone material and specimens collected in the 19th and early 20th century. \n\nWhile the team found no evidence of those particular species, their survey of both island systems provided valuable data about the distribution of other endemic and introduced reptiles.
