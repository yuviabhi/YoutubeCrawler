Eventually, her analysis of DNA-sequence data will be incorporated into a research paper slated for publication. For Gavriela, the opportunity to take part in ongoing scientific research has enhanced her interest in a career in science.\n\nThe Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP\u2014pronounced \"shrimp\") offers New York City high school students the chance to join ongoing research projects led by Museum scientists.

Throughout the two years, the program includes college readiness sessions, professional development workshops, individual and group coaching, academic counseling, and access to the faculty, staff, and resources at Mount Sinai.\n\nThe Lloyd Sherman Scholars Program is named after Lloyd Sherman EdD, the founding director of CEYE, for of his longstanding commitment to exposing underrepresented minorities and economically disadvantaged youth to science and medicine.\n\nLearn more about the Lloyd Sherman Scholars Program: http:\/\/icahn.mssm.edu\/about\/diversity\/ceye\n\nFounded by the American Museum of Natural History, the NYC Science Research Mentoring Consortium is a group of New York City academic, research and cultural institutions committed to providing high-potential, underrepresented NYC high school students with mentored, authentic research experiences in STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Math).
