Biologists today have the knowledge, the tools, and the ability to influence the evolution of life on Earth.

This finding, and the visualization of the placental ancestor -- an insect-eating animal that weighed less than a pound -- was made with the help of a cloud-based and publicly accessible database called MorphoBank.\n\nMorphoBank is an initiative funded primarily by NSF with additional support from Stony Brook University, the American Museum of Natural History, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and the National Evolutionary Synthesis Center.\n\nVisit MorphoBank at http:\/\/mammaltree.informatics.sunysb.edu\/.","playlistId":"PLrfcruGtplwGRlrV1iwlzO-iAH4PAi7k2","position":7,"publishedAt":"2018-02-09T16:58:25.000Z","title":"Researchers Reconstruct the Common Ancestor of Placental Mammals","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jBBJvgK5YAg\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jBBJvgK5YAg\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jBBJvgK5YAg\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/jBBJvgK5YAg\/sddefault.jpg","width":640}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"jBBJvgK5YAg"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"jBBJvgK5YAg","videoPublishedAt":"2013-02-07T19:00:32.000Z"}}]}
