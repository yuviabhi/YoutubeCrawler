Because the fossil record is incomplete, we have not found fossils of this common ancestor; however, based on the characteristics we see in all dinosaurs, we can determine new and unique characteristics it possessed.\n\nA key evolutionary innovation of dinosaurs is that they walk with a fully erect posture, holding their hind legs vertically under their hips. The top of the thighbone (or femur) has a knob or head that sticks out to the side of the rest of the bone and fits into the hip socket (or acetabulum) in the pelvis. The hip socket has a hole in the center, as well as a rim of bone along the upper margin, which helps support the weight of the body on the leg. Since these features are present in all known dinosaurs, we deduce that they first evolved in the common ancestor.\n\nIn popular culture, many other kinds of animals, which don't have this fully developed hip and leg structure, are often incorrectly called dinosaurs. Some examples include Mesozoic marine reptiles, such as plesiosaurs, mosasaurs and ichthyosaurs, as well as a group of Mesozoic flying reptiles called pterosaurs.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

Then, Englishman Robert Plot described the lower end of a thighbone that formed the knee of Megalosaurus, a carnivorous dinosaur common in Jurassic rocks there, which walked on its two hind legs. At the time, however, Plot did not recognize his find as the bone of a long-dead reptile.\n\nBy the 1820s, our anatomical acuity had come a long way. Fossils of Megalosaurus and Iguanodon, an Early Cretaceous herbivorous dinosaur, were discovered by geologists and doctors in England and recognized to belong to giant extinct reptiles. Then, a couple of decades later, in 1841, the famous English anatomist Sir Richard Owen first coined the name Dinosauria, meaning \"terrible lizard,\" to refer to this group of what he considered to be enormous, extinct, lizard-like reptiles.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

Although this process may seem unnecessary, it is extremely important in making sure that all paleontologists understand what kind of dinosaur is being referred to when a name is used.\n\nThe code requires that a scientific name be composed to two parts. The first part, called the genus, is always capitalized; the second, called the species is never capitalized. Both names are always italicized, and sometimes the genus name is abbreviated (as in T. rex for Tyrannosaurus rex). The genus name may be used alone to refer to all the species in a particular genus.\n\nThe first person to describe a new kind of dinosaur assigns the animal its name, and these names are often derived from Greek or Latin words. Many names reflect key characteristics of the animal, such as the place the specimen was collected, the person who collected the fossil, or one of the animal's unusual anatomical characteristics.\nThe new name is based on one particular fossil, which is called the type specimen, and this type specimen must be complete enough to exhibit features that clearly distinguish it from all other species. Any specimens discovered later that are thought to belong to the new species must be found to have no significant differences with the type specimen.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

In an evolutionary sense, birds are a living group of dinosaurs because they descended from the common ancestor of all dinosaurs. Other than birds, however, there is no scientific evidence that any dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus, Velociraptor, Apatosaurus, Stegosaurus, or Triceratops, are still alive. These, and all other nonavian dinosaurs became extinct at least 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous Period.\n\nMany, shared, evolutionary characteristics can be found in the skeletons of birds and other dinosaurs. One can follow the development of these evolutionary innovations by following along the evolutionary tree of dinosaurs from larger groups into successively smaller ones.\nBirds' hips have a hole in the hip socket, just like all other dinosaurs. This feature was inherited from the common ancestor of dinosaurs and allowed dinosaurs to walk with an upright posture. Next, the bones of birds are hollow, and the hind feet of birds have three toes that point forward and one toe that points backwards, just like the hollow bones and three-toed feet inherited from the common ancestor of all meat-eating or theropod dinosaurs, including Tyrannosaurus. \n\nFinally, the wrist of birds is built around a crescent-shaped bone called the semi-lunate carpal, just as the wrist of Velociraptor is. This wrist bone was inherited from the common ancestor of birds, Velociraptor, and other dinosaurs that belong to the group called maniraptors. As documented by these characteristics, birds evolved from the first dinosaur, the first theropod dinosaur, and the first maniraptor. So scientifically, birds are members of all of these groups of dinosaurs. \n\nSo, in an evolutionary sense, birds are a living group of dinosaurs, and although no nonavian dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus or Triceratops, still exist, dinosaurs are not extinct! You see dinosaurs flying around in the sky and perching in trees every day!\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

However, given that the fossil record is incomplete, in the sense that we've yet to discover fossils of many other kinds of dinosaurs that no doubt did exist, the stated numbers almost certainly do not reflect the true diversity of extinct dinosaurs.\n\nOne reason for this incompleteness of the fossil record is that rocks for some geologic time periods are not very commonly found on the surface for us to collect. For example, many more kinds of Late Cretaceous dinosaurs are known than Middle Jurassic dinosaurs because outcrops of Late Cretaceous are more numerous and more widely spread geographically than those of Middle Jurassic age.\n\nBut in reality, the number of known extinct dinosaurs pales in comparison to the number of dinosaurs living today! This is because birds are actually a group of living dinosaurs, since evolutionary analyses document that birds evolved from some species of small carnivorous dinosaur similar to Velociraptor. (See: Are there any dinosaurs alive today?) Again estimates vary, but there are at least 10,000 species of living birds, which again suggests that there are many more species of extinct dinosaurs yet to be discovered.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

Because dinosaurs were (and in the form of birds still are) such a diverse group or animals, they probably lived in nearly every terrestrial environment. Their fossils, be they bones, teeth, or footprints, have been found in Mesozoic rocks that are geologically interpreted to have been deposited in deserts, savannahs, forests, beaches, and swamps.\n\nDinosaur fossils have even been discovered in Antarctica and North America, but could they really survive polar conditions? During most of the Mesozoic, the world was quite different than our modern world. The global climate was much warmer, and polar ice caps probably did not exist. Also, the continents were not as widely separated by large oceans as they are today. Nonetheless, studies of ancient geography indicate that some dinosaurs that lived in Alaska, Antarctica, and even Australia lived very near the Earth's poles. Even with the warmer climate, these dinosaurs would have experienced extensive periods of darkness, which would have drastically affected the food supply of herbivorous dinosaurs. Exactly how they adapted to these conditions, perhaps through hibernation or migration, remains a mystery because there is little scientific evidence that can be gathered to test these potential mechanisms.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

However, based on the age of the specimens that we do have, that first dinosaur may well have lived in the earlier portions of the Triassic Period.\nThe earliest dinosaurs for which we do have well-documented fossils are found in Late Triassic Ischigualasto Formation in northern Argentina. Skeletons discovered in these rock layers include the meat-eating dinosaurs Herrerasaurus and Eoraptor, as well as the plant-eating dinosaur Pisanosaurus. Some of the rock layers from this formation are composed of ancient volcanic ash, which has yielded a radioisotopic age of 228 million years ago. \n\nOther possible candidates include dinosaur remains from Late Triassic rock layers of the Petrified Forest in Arizona, the Wolfville Formation in Nova Scotia, and some rock formations in Brazil. But unfortunately, no radioisotopic dates have been obtained from rock layers in these units. Based on other kinds of fossils found in these formations, such as fossil pollen and other kinds of vertebrates, it appears that dinosaurs from these rock layers are slightly younger than the skeletons of Herrerasaurus, Eoraptor, and Pisanosaurus from the Ischigualasto Formation.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

But deciding which was the largest depends on what one means -- longest or heaviest? In addition, some immense sauropods are only known from fragmentary remains, making it difficult to estimate their true size and weight.\n\nNonetheless, it's clear based on fairly complete skeletons that the sauropods Argentinosaurus and Seismosaurus, which were up to 50 meters long, are the longest dinosaurs yet discovered. Various models have been used to estimate the weight of large dinosaurs. Based on these models, it's probable that Apatosaurus and Argentinosaurus were heavier than Brachiosaurus, which is not terribly long (at 22 meters), but is estimated to have weighed between 30 and 90 tons, depending on which model is used.\n\nSince birds are a group of living dinosaurs, answering which is the smallest dinosaur is a bit of a trick question, because the smallest dinosaurs ever known are actually birds. For example, the bee humming bird from Cuba weighs only 1.95 grams and is small enough to fit into a teaspoon. But among dinosaurs that aren't birds, or nonavian dinosaurs, the diminuitive Compsognathus longus, an Early Jurassic, chicken-sized meat-eater from Western Europe is the smallest yet discovered. It measures only 70 centimeters long, including the tail, and probably weighed about three kilograms.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

Most dinosaurs with sharp, bladed and serrated teeth, like steak knives, belong to the group of dinosaurs called theropods, such as Tyrannosaurus, Allosaurus, and Velociraptor, and most likely used their teeth to slash prey and slice meat. Other dinosaurs possessing sets of teeth that wore down into flat grinding surfaces as the animal chewed, such as Triceratops and duckbills, most likely used their teeth to grind or shred leaves, seeds, and other vegetation.\n\nOne can also look at the position of the jaw joint to get a general sense of an animal's diet. If the joint between the upper and lower jaws is at the same level as the tooth rows, as in modern cats and other carnivores, the animal was probably a meat-eater whose jaw muscles allowed the jaws to close with tremendous speed and precision, as was likely the case with Tyrannosaurus. However, if the jaw joint was lower than the tooth rows, such as in modern herbivores, the jaw muscles allowed the teeth in the upper and lower jaws to move back-and-forth or side-to-side across each other to grind or slice vegetation, as was likely the case in Triceratops and duckbills.\n\nAlthough it's often impossible to determine exactly what a specific kind of dinosaur ate, certain fossils occasionally provide clues. Some \"mummified\" duckbills preserve fossilized stomach contents in the ribcage, including conifer needles, twigs, seeds, and fruits. Some AMNH Coelophysis skeletons at reveal the bones of small crocodiles inside the ribcage that probably represent the animal's last meal. Also, coprolites (fossilized feces) can also provide clues to diet. Bone fragments in one coprolite associated with a skeleton of a Velociraptor-like dinosaur from Mongolia shows that it was eating small, lizard-sized animals.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

For example, immense sauropods, such as Apatosaurus and Diplodocus with their massive bodies and columnar leg structure, were probably not fast runners other than in short bursts. Conversely, lighter and relatively long-limbed theropods, such as Velociraptor and ornithomimids (or \"ostrich-mimic dinosaurs) were probably capable of running at high, sustained speeds.\n\nAbsolute speeds for extinct animals have been estimated by using complex models in which the length of the stride (as measured from trails of fossil footprints called trackways) and leg length is compared to the same data measured in living animals. Such comparisons are complicated by the fact that it's often difficult to identify the exact kind of dinosaur that made a specific trackway, especially because fossil skeletons of dinosaurs are often rare or absent in rock layers that preserve fossil footprints.\n\nLike many aspects of extinct dinosaur behavior or biology, the speed of different dinosaurs have been subject to fantastic and speculative claims that are difficult to test rigorously with reliable scientific evidence. However, the available evidence and models suggest that, while larger dinosaurs may have been capable of running, they were predominately slow-footed and unable to attain the speeds of even a moderately fast human sprinter.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

Doing so in living animals is often difficult and controversial. Paleontologists commonly try to estimate intelligence in dinosaurs by comparing the size of the brain to the size of the body, a measure called the encephalization quotient. But incomplete fossils commonly complicate measuring the brain size, and accurately determining body mass is also difficult.\n\nNonetheless, by measuring the size of the brain cavity in available dinosaur skulls, it's clear that some dinosaurs had relatively larger brains (meaning encephalization quotients) than others and that dinosaurs' brains were not unusually small compared to those of living reptiles, such as crocodiles, turtles and lizards. Does this mean they were equally intelligent? Not necessarily. For example, Neanderthals have larger brains than we do, but few would argue that they were more intelligent than we are.\n\nOne can also examine the organization of the three main parts of the brain: the stem, which regulates heartbeat, respiration and other functions; the cerebellum, which coordinates muscle movements; and the cerebrum, which is involved with complex sensory functions and memory. Enlargement and more complexity in these regions suggest enhanced abilities that might be associated with intelligence. The cerebrum and cerebellum are relatively large in birds, which are living dinosaurs, and mammals. This implies enhanced sensory capabilities and memory. In Velociraptor and its close relatives, the cerebrum and cerebellum appear large and bird-like, possibly indicating enhanced abilities. All in all, some dinosaurs were probably about as intelligent as primitive birds, such as modern ostriches, but not as intelligent as more advanced birds, whose brains are even larger and more complex.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

So it is not surprising that dinosaurs did, too, especially since we can observe combat in the closest living relatives of extinct dinosaurs, crocodiles and birds. But direct evidence of fighting in extinct dinosaurs is rare.\n\nThe most spectacular example of predator\/prey combat in extinct dinosaurs was discovered in Mongolia. A carnivorous theropod, Velociraptor, is entwined in a 72-million-year-old death struggle with a primitive, herbivorous, horned dinosaur, Protoceratops. The right arm of the Velociraptor is caught in the mouth of the Protoceratops, and the hand of Velociraptor grasps the face of its foe. The large sickle-shaped claw on the hind foot of Velociraptor is imbedded in the neck of the Protoceratops, right where the carotid artery would be. The exact circumstances surrounding the scene are unknown, but the position of the bones document that the animals were interacting while they were alive.\n\nTwo other specimens document combat between individuals of the same species. One is a 65-million-year-old skeleton of Tyrannosaurus rex discovered in South Dakota. This bad boy was really beat up. One eye socket in the skull is nearly closed by abnormal healing of the surrounding bone. On another part of the skull, the broken tip of a tooth from another tyrannosaur in embedded. Around this tooth are the characteristic marks of bone growth that occurs during healing, indicating that the animal survived the attack. Another skull of Velociraptor from Mongolia exhibits two rows of parallel punctures on the frontal bone that appear to be tooth marks. The pattern of tooth marks corresponds identically with the spacing of teeth in the upper jaw of Velociraptor. No healing of bone is evident, suggesting that the rival dealt a fatal blow to the victim's brain.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

So it's not surprising that fossils provide evidence that non-avian dinosaurs did so, too. But direct fossil evidence for nests and eggs is unusual because these objects are fragile and easily eroded or destroyed.\n\nThe Central Asiatic Expeditions, led by AMNH's Roy Chapman Andrews and Walter Granger, discovered some of the earliest, well-preserved dinosaur eggs in Mongolia during the 1920s. The oval-shaped eggs, about 20 cm long, were thought to belong to the most commonly found dinosaur at the Flaming Cliffs, Protoceratops. However, AMNH expeditions in the 1990s discovered identical eggs, one of which contained the embryo of an Oviraptor-like dinosaur, which altered our view of which dinosaur laid these eggs. Also, skeletons of Oviraptor were discovered squatting on top of clusters of eggs, with their arms folded back against their body, just like many living birds brood on their nests.\n\nEven some giant, long-necked sauropod dinosaurs laid eggs and built nests, as documented by discoveries during the 1990s by AMNH paleontologists in Patagonia. There, rock layers containing thousands of spherical fossil eggs, about 15 cm in diameter, were strewn across low ridges and flats over several square km. Careful collecting revealed that a few of these eggs contained fossilized embryos of a kind of sauropod called a titanosaur. When hatching, these tiniest giants would have been only 30-36 cm long. A few well-preserved nest structures showed that the titanosaurs intentionally excavated a basin about 1.5 m across in which to lay between 15 and 35 eggs at a time, and the presence of fossil eggs in at least six different rock layers showed that the titanosaurs returned to this nesting site many times.\n\nEpisode 1: What Is and Is Not a Dinosaur? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/Me8BrHY57JI\n\nEpisode 2: Who Discovered the First Dinosaur Fossils? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/FbPGrB-BmH0\n\nEpisode 3: How Do Dinosaurs Get Their Names? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/Wrdmw_Ioovk\n\nEpisode 4: Are Any Dinosaurs Still Alive Today?\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/947j2zXm8WA\n\nEpisode 5: How Many Kinds of Dinosaurs Are There?\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/xdGe2tMdjxs\n\nEpisode 6: Where in the World Did Dinosaurs Live?\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/0lGXGz_lALM\n\nEpisode 7: What Is the Earliest-Known Dinosaur?\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/62LK_Ny905o\n\nEpisode 8: What Were the Biggest and Smallest Dinosaurs? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/Icp9eIVMBwU\n\nEpisode 9: What Did Dinosaurs Eat? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/dYrNWPyLtlI\n\nEpisode 10: How Fast Were Dinosaurs?\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/GKsygFxt4XI\n\nEpisode 11: How Intelligent were Dinosaurs?\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/pXFHtwVQxqk\n\nEpisode 12: Did Dinosaurs Fight?\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/hiqlCBH-5C0\n\nEpisode 13: How Did Dinosaurs Reproduce? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/Kp4Dg8XBeUA\n\nEpisode 14: Did Dinosaurs Travel in Herds or Packs? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/jtbpusl0Vo0\n\nEpisode 15: What Was Dinosaur Skin Like? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/6i3EmBNYptk\n\nEpisode 16: How Fast Did Dinosaurs Grow, and How Long Did They Live?\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/KyUptMWcmZI\n\nEpisode 17: What Color Were Extinct Dinosaurs? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/bN7XTFlxPTI\n\nEpisode 18: Were Dinosaurs Warm-Blooded? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/oy8Kvt1vOto\n\nEpisode 19: How Did All Dinosaurs Except Birds Go Extinct? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/mCKeogDioWE\n\nEpisode 20: Can We Clone Extinct Dinosaurs From DNA Preserved in Their Fossils? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/H1E_Nwj2dro\n\nEpisode 21: What Is a Fossil? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/WWHJqnfmhQ8\n\nEpisode 22: How Do We Know Where to Look for Dinosaur Fossils? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/XQRZqG7wCPQ\n\nEpisode 23: How Are Dinosaur Fossils Discovered and Collected? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/rYjs8Wtfnzo\n\nEpisode 24: How Are Dinosaur Fossils Prepared in the Laboratory? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/6brUGBR6ll0\n\nEpisode 25: How are skeletal mounts of dinosaurs in museum exhibits built?\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/FZNq4SgUqgE\n\nEpisode 26: Where are all the dinosaur fossils kept once they're prepared?\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/r8ENj3lTTWk\n\nEpisode 27: How Do We Know Which Kind of Dinosaurs Were Most Closely Related? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/3gNw_6DoVc8\n\nEpisode 28: How do we know how long ago dinosaurs lived? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/6pYPqtdTnrM\n\nEpisode 29: In what kind of environments did dinosaurs live? \nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/62Z-iSwh3i4\n\nEpisode 30: How does studying dinosaurs benefit humanity?\nhttp:\/\/youtu.be\/vGzVaprEbqs \n\n***\nSubscribe to our channel: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/subscription_center?add_user=AMNHorg\n\nCheck out our full video catalog: \nhttp:\/\/www.youtube.com\/user\/AMNHorg\n\nFacebook: http:\/\/fb.com\/naturalhistory \nTwitter: http:\/\/twitter.com\/amnh\nTumblr: http:\/\/amnhnyc.tumblr.com\/\nInstagram: http:\/\/instagram.com\/amnh","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":13,"publishedAt":"2012-09-17T15:33:59.000Z","title":"How Did Dinosaurs Reproduce?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Kp4Dg8XBeUA\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Kp4Dg8XBeUA\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Kp4Dg8XBeUA\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Kp4Dg8XBeUA\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/Kp4Dg8XBeUA\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"Kp4Dg8XBeUA"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"Kp4Dg8XBeUA","videoPublishedAt":"2012-09-17T15:33:34.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/ek9SqPggdEfffiYS8GpC1i77nnw\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LjM5NTNDNEE1NUYwMDRGMTY=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Since living birds are living dinosaurs, we know that modern dinosaurs often travel in flocks, exhibiting a complex social structure. But did extinct, non-avian dinosaurs do the same? Over the last several decades, numerous claims have been made that they did, but finding unequivocal evidence of herding in the fossil record is difficult.\n\nThe most definitive evidence comes from sequences of fossilized footprints called trackways. Several track sites have now been found that suggest herding behavior in some groups of dinosaurs. At the Davenport Ranch site outside San Antonio, Texas, R. T. Bird of AMNH discovered an amazing set of sauropods tracks in 1940. Detailed analyses of these trackways reveal a herd of 23 sauropods rambling over muddy ground at a pace of about 2 meters per second. The pattern of overlapping tracks indicates that the largest adult sauropods led the herd, followed by smaller individuals. \n\nOther trackways in Colorado and Korea show herds of large sauropods moving side-by-side in a horizontal front. At one site in Colorado, the animals' paths undulate from left to right in unison.\n\nTrackways of meat-eating theropods are less common, but one occurrence is Bird's specimen from Glen Rose, Texas, a part of which is on display at AMNH. In all, the Paluxy River trackways, some of which were sent to other institutions, reveal the footprints of at least 12 sauropods and at least three, large, carnivorous dinosaurs moving along a mudflat above the waterline. But it is unclear how long after the sauropods passed that the theropods followed or if they moved in a pack. However, in Bolivia, paleontologist Giusseppe Leonardi discovered eight parallel trackways of six adult and two juvenile sauropods moving along the shore in a front, followed shortly afterward by a pack of at least 32 medium sized, carnivorous theropods, moving in the same general direction along the same front.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

In birds, the only living group of dinosaurs, the scales are modified into feathers, except around the feet and beak. So, the hind feet of extinct dinosaurs probably looked like a bird's foot, but what about the rest of their body? \n\nRare, non-avian dinosaur \"mummies\" provide intriguing direct evidence. Impressions of dinosaur skin are only preserved under most extraordinary circumstances, for example, in an environment that is extremely dry or that lacks sufficient oxygen to support organisms that quickly decompose soft tissues. One of these is the AMNH Edmontosaurus \"mummy, one of the greatest dinosaur fossils ever collected. Impressions of skin are preserved over almost the entire body. The surface is covered by tubercles of varying size. Some are large and diamond-shaped; others are small and rounded. Around the base of the limbs, on the neck, and at other joints, the skin is folded, like that surrounding the joints of an elephant, presumably to allow flexibility during movement. The mummy's remarkable preservation is attributed to the notion that it lay unscavenged on the sandbar of an ancient stream for a short period, during which its skin dried out and its tendons and ligaments contracted, leaving the carcass in a contorted \"death pose.\" Shortly thereafter, a flood quickly buried it.\n\nAnother remarkable recent discovery in Patagonia reveals what the skin of some giant dinosaurs was like just before they hatched. Some of the fossilized eggs, about the size of a grapefruit, contained fossilized embryos of sauropods called titanosaurs, which were about 30-36 cm long, and patches of fossilized skin revealed that bumpy, scale-like plates, arranged in rows and rosettes, covered the embryos. The embryos were killed when a flood inundated their nesting site and buried the eggs.","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":15,"publishedAt":"2012-09-17T15:38:20.000Z","title":"What Was Dinosaur Skin Like?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6i3EmBNYptk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6i3EmBNYptk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6i3EmBNYptk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6i3EmBNYptk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6i3EmBNYptk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"6i3EmBNYptk"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"6i3EmBNYptk","videoPublishedAt":"2012-09-17T15:37:29.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/43w9Nz2Z4FIEEPfYPOBzmRDNJXI\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LkRFMzMyNDY5RTU3NjA5NjE=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Until recently, paleontologists could only guess about these questions. Because many extinct, non-avian dinosaurs, such as Tyrannosaurus and Apatosaurus, are so immense, it was generally assumed that they grew slowly and required 50-100 years to attain their great size. \n\nBut recent research involving microscopic analyses of the cellular structure of dinosaur bone has revolutionized our answers to these mysteries. Dinosaur bones contain growth rings, somewhat like the rings in tree trunks, which reveal yearly periods of rapid and slow growth. By studying growth rings in Tyrannosaurus bones, scientists can estimate how fast the animal was growing at different times in its life and how old individual animals were when they died. \n\nThese studies, done in conjunction with paleontologists at AMNH, document that that Tyrannosaurus, which attained a weight of more than 10,000 pounds as an adult, reached sexual maturity at about 20 years of age and lived for up to 28 years. In order to obtain its immense size and weight, it could put on almost five pounds a day during its phase of maximum growth. As one might expect, these rates of relative growth are fairly similar to those found in birds, which are the closest living relatives of Tyrannosaurus.Microscopic studies of these growth rings in Apatosaurus bones suggest that this sauropod's period of fastest growth occurred between about 7 and 13 years of age, when the animal gained about 32 pounds a day - or about 6 tons a year! Although paleontologists used to think that gigantic dinosaurs lived a century or so, based on studies of living reptiles like giant tortoises, growth rings show that their life span was probably a lot shorter, perhaps only 30-40 years.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

In part, this shift reflects the scientific switch from viewing dinosaurs as drab relatives of crocodiles and lizards to viewing dinosaurs as closer relatives of birds. But is there any direct fossil evidence for this change? Well, the answer is no... and yes.\n\nNo fossils of extinct dinosaurs, including \"mummies\" complete with fossilized skin impressions, have yet revealed the true color of the dinosaur's skin, at least in terms of what we usually think of as skin. There are fossils of a couple of turtles from the Cenozoic Era that are thought to preserve the pattern of pigmentation on the shell. Nonetheless, in terms of non-feathered dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus and duckbills, no evidence for skin color has yet been found.\n\nRecently, however, a great wealth of astounding fossils representing small, feathered dinosaurs that are not birds has been collected in Early Cretaceous rocks in China, especially near Liaoning. Fossilized feathers, basically modified scales that grow in the skin, have been found on numerous specimens. In 2008, researchers discovered microscopic structures, called melanosomes, within fossilized feathers of an ancient bird. Different kinds of melanosomes create different colors in the feathers. \n\nFollowing this discovery in 2010, two teams of researchers reported finding melanosomes preserved in feathers of two, small, Chinese, non-avian dinosaurs -- Sinosauropteryx and Anchiornis. In the more comprehensive study of Anchiornis, in which 29 samples were analyzed from feathers all over the body of one specimen, revealed that this 155-million-year-old, feathered dinosaur, about the size of a chicken, possessed black-and-white stripped wings and a rusty brown crest of feathers along the top and back of its skull.","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":17,"publishedAt":"2012-09-24T13:59:36.000Z","title":"What Color Were Extinct Dinosaurs?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bN7XTFlxPTI\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bN7XTFlxPTI\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bN7XTFlxPTI\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bN7XTFlxPTI\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/bN7XTFlxPTI\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"bN7XTFlxPTI"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"bN7XTFlxPTI","videoPublishedAt":"2012-09-24T13:59:09.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/aSGU2zoAGVMWoi4ejM4043K8sKM\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LjI4QzlEQjM0NTI0OEZGQkU=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Some chemical reactions in the body, such as the burning of sugar to produce energy while releasing carbon dioxide and water, are referred to as metabolism. These reactions run most efficiently at a particular optimum temperature. In mammals and birds, the optimum temperature is higher than the normal outside temperature and is regulated internally. So these animals maintain generally higher body temperatures and are called \"warm-blooded\" or endothermic, for their internal temperature control. \n\nOther animals, such as turtles, crocodiles, and lizards, have more variable body temperatures based on their level of activity and regulate body temperature through external sources, such as warming up in the sun or cooling off in the shade. Thus, they are often called \"cold-blooded,\" or more appropriately, ectothermic, for their external temperature control. \n\nWere dinosaurs ectothermic or endothermic? Since birds are a group of living dinosaurs, we know that at least some dinosaurs are endothermic. But the question of whether all dinosaurs were endothermic is more difficult to answer. One approach to investigate this question is to look at the microscopic structure of bone. In many ectothermic animals, bone grows in dense, concentric rings, somewhat like tree rings. In endothermic animals, a complex system of closely spaced cavities, called the Haversian system, permeates the bone. By cutting bones of extinct, non-avian dinosaurs into thin slices and examining them under the microscope, we can look for these characteristics.\n \nHowever, many complications exist, such as the need to compare animals of similar size, and no living dinosaurs as large as Tyrannosaurus and Apatosaurus exist today for us to observe. In most non-avian dinosaurs, the microstructure of the bone looks more like that of ectotherms, but the evidence is not conclusive. Because birds are endothermic, it's clear that \"warm-bloodedness\" evolved somewhere along the evolutionary tree of dinosaurs. But it is not yet possible to identify with certainty which groups of non-avian dinosaurs were \"warm-blooded.\"","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":18,"publishedAt":"2012-09-24T14:23:14.000Z","title":"Were Dinosaurs Warm-Blooded?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/oy8Kvt1vOto\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/oy8Kvt1vOto\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/oy8Kvt1vOto\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/oy8Kvt1vOto\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/oy8Kvt1vOto\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"oy8Kvt1vOto"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"oy8Kvt1vOto","videoPublishedAt":"2012-09-24T14:22:42.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/6NWR3Kse1iMliZJnultpBXuQOzQ\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LkVDRjRGOUJEN0MzMzUxOTU=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"The extinction of non-avian dinosaurs except birds at the end of the Cretaceous has intrigued paleontologists for more than a century. In the 1900s, numerous speculative hypotheses were proposed. One was that dinosaurs just got too big, but the largest dinosaurs, such as Apatosaurus, lived long before the end of the Cretaceous. \n\nThen in 1980, Walter and Luis Alvarez discovered that a bed of marine clay in Italy, right at the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, contained abnormally high levels of iridium, an element rare in rocks on the Earth's surface but more common in asteroids and comets. Thus, they argued that an asteroid, about 10 km across, impacted the Earth, generating massive tsunamis, with impact debris cutting off sunlight for months, stopping photosynthesis, and causing freezing temperatures. Chemical reactions in the atmosphere caused acid rain and long-term global warming, all of which extinguished non-avian dinosaurs. Rocks from an impact crater called Chicxulub, buried beneath the shore of the Yucatan Peninsula, were dated radioisotopically at 65 million years, right when the extinctions occurred, confirming an impact.\n\nHowever, at the same time, massive lava flows erupted across what is now southwest India. These layers of lava, called the Deccan Traps, are up to 2,400 m thick and cover an area as large as California. They represent the second largest episode of continental volcanism in the Earth's history. The eruptions occurred over a 500,000 year period spanning the end of the Cretaceous, and probably caused many of the same effects as the impact: reduced sunlight, acid rain, short-term cooling, long-term greenhouse warming.\n\nAlthough most scientists believe that the impact represented the final blow for non-avian dinosaurs, the fact that both events occurred when these dinosaurs went extinct suggests that both events, with their similar \"killing mechanisms,\" could well have played a role.","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":19,"publishedAt":"2012-10-01T13:39:16.000Z","title":"How Did All Dinosaurs Except Birds Go Extinct?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mCKeogDioWE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mCKeogDioWE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mCKeogDioWE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mCKeogDioWE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/mCKeogDioWE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"mCKeogDioWE"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"mCKeogDioWE","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-01T13:38:55.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/QF7rLMEBmI3otOsBwzeux-ZefkA\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LjlGRTI3Q0E5NjIwRDU2OTI=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Paleontologists and molecular biologists have now searched for a couple of decades to find and replicate DNA from some non-avian dinosaur fossil. But to date, no such unequivocally confirmed results have been obtained, either from fossil bones or teeth preserved in sediments or from some fossil preserved in amber, as was done in Jurassic Park. \n\nTo successfully isolate DNA from a long-extinct dinosaur, let alone clone one, scientists would have to overcome numerous serious challenges, including contamination and deterioration of the original DNA. This is because DNA begins to deteriorate and break down into small molecular fragments soon after an organism dies and begins to decay, and when that happens, contamination from external sources, such as organic compounds in the soil or groundwater, quickly follows.\n\nThe DNA molecule is composed of subunits, called base pairs, and each pair forms part of the genetic code. In our bodies, each cell contains a billion base pairs, so replicating each in the proper order for an extinct dinosaur would be tremendously difficult. In terms of an analogy, think of the Manhattan phone book. It has an alphabetical order and a specific content, including names and addresses. If that phone book were shredded into millions of tiny pieces of varying lengths, as happens to DNA when it deteriorates, how would you go about reassembling the original book? Names might be missing, but you would not know which ones. These are the kinds of problems that face scientists trying to reconstruct DNA from extinct animals.\n\nEventually, scientists probably will be able to confirm the presence of DNA from some non-avian dinosaur. But at present, we cannot create carbon copies of organisms that are alive today, even if we have the entire genome in its correct order. Thus, isolating and organizing the decayed DNA from a long-extinct, non-avian dinosaur, even if we found some, would be impossible.","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":20,"publishedAt":"2012-10-01T13:39:56.000Z","title":"Can We Clone Extinct Dinosaurs From DNA Preserved in Their Fossils?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/H1E_Nwj2dro\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/H1E_Nwj2dro\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/H1E_Nwj2dro\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/H1E_Nwj2dro\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/H1E_Nwj2dro\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"H1E_Nwj2dro"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"H1E_Nwj2dro","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-01T13:39:35.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/NrrKoug_oWk1bKoJZmPmJPST6vI\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LkRGOTI0NUY2NkE0OTU4MUE=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Paleontology is the science of studying fossils from ancient organisms, and paleontologists are scientists who find and study those fossils.\n\nDefinitions of exactly what constitutes a fossil vary to some extent, but basically, fossils are naturally preserved physical traces of long-dead organisms. Usually, these traces consist of an organism's hard parts, such as bones, teeth, shells, or wood. Occasionally, when conditions are optimal, soft parts of organisms can also fossilize, such as impressions of skin, body outlines, and, more commonly, leaves. In almost all cases, fossils provide information about the original shape and structure of these physical traces; however, they usually do not provide any information about the original color of the body parts. Other traces of objects made by organisms, such as footprints, burrows, and nests, also qualify to be called fossils. Also, most definitions of fossils require that the organism's body part or other physical trace be more than 10,000 years old in order to truly be called a fossil.\n\nHowever, objects made by prehistoric humans, such as pottery, arrowheads and buildings, are not considered to be fossils, but instead are referred to as anthropological artifacts.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

So in looking for dinosaur fossils, one must find outcrops of sedimentary rocks.\n\nSecond, no dinosaurs are known to have lived in the ocean, where most sedimentary rocks form. Instead, one must look in sedimentary rocks that were deposited on the continents, primarily by rivers and streams or in lakes into which the streams emptied. Occasionally, dinosaur fossils are also found in sedimentary rocks representing ancient, desert sand dunes and their associated habitats.\n\nThird, the sedimentary rocks must have been formed or deposited during the Mesozoic Era, the geologic time period when nonavian dinosaurs lived. Finally, it's best to search in regions where little vegetation covers the surface of the ground, so that any fossil fragments weathering out of the sedimentary rock layers can be more easily seen. These regions of barren ridges and ravines are often called badlands. \n\nIn order to find appropriate, Mesozoic, sedimentary rock layers, paleontologists often use geologic maps, which document the kinds of rock layers of different geologic ages that are exposed on the surface. Once appropriate rock layers are found, the search for dinosaur fossils can begin with a reasonable hope of finding the kinds of dinosaurs one is searching for. But commonly, other kinds of fossils are serendipitously discovered during the search.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

To be successful, this fieldwork requires considerable funding and careful planning. Each trip is designed to try and find fossils that will shed new light on particular research questions. Commonly, fossils have already been found in the region where the fieldwork is conducted, but if not, geologic maps and satellite photos are used to identify areas where rocks of the right age and ancient environment are exposed on the surface.\n\nTo find fossils, paleontologists first carry out an operation called prospecting, which involves slowly hiking across ridges and through ravines, while keeping one's eyes focused on the ground in hopes of finding fragments of fossils weathering out on the surface. Commonly, one covers 5-10 miles in a day of prospecting. Once a fossil fragment is found, the collector brushes away the loose dirt on the surface to see if more of the specimen is buried in the ground. If so, quarrying is initiated to collect the fossil. First, awls, rock hammers, chisels, and other tools are used to remove the rock covering the bones to see how much of the skeleton is present. As bone is exposed, special glue is applied to the cracks and fractures to hold the fossil together. \n\nNext, a trench is dug around the bones so that they essentially sit on a low pedestal. A covering of damp toilet paper is placed over the bones before a layer of plaster bandages is wrapped around the bones to create a hard cast, just like a doctor does around a broken bone. Once the cast hardens, excavating the bone is completed, and the fossil in its cast is packed for shipment back to the museum.","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":23,"publishedAt":"2012-10-09T15:19:12.000Z","title":"How Are Dinosaur Fossils Discovered and Collected?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rYjs8Wtfnzo\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rYjs8Wtfnzo\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rYjs8Wtfnzo\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rYjs8Wtfnzo\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/rYjs8Wtfnzo\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"rYjs8Wtfnzo"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"rYjs8Wtfnzo","videoPublishedAt":"2012-10-09T15:18:49.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/S-_baOkYifAEkKmgR8GBL_RCb7s\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LkM2MjZBQTA1QTMxQUU0QTc=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Fossil preparators are highly skilled technicians who restore the naturally fractured bones and teeth of fossil to the original state, somewhat like art conservators restore damaged paintings and sculptures.\n\nWhen fossils arrive from the field, they are encased in plaster jackets, and the rock, or matrix, which was deposited around the fossils. Fossil preparation involves cutting open the plaster jacket and removing this matrix surrounding the fossil. The matrix may be soft and crumbly, when the sand or mud is poorly cemented together, or it can be extremely hard, when the sediments are well cemented. Accordingly, a wide variety of tools is required to remove the matrix and stabilize the fossil. Commonly, dental tools are used to carefully pick away sediment near the bone, along with custom-made needles composed of carbide steel. Formerly, chisels and hammers were used to remove blocks of matrix further away from the bone, but recently, smaller mechanical tools have taken their place. These include small grinding wheels, miniature jackhammers called air scribes, and tiny sand-blasters, all powered by compressed air.\n\nWhen using these tools, the work is often conducted while peering through a precision microscope under high-quality lighting to make sure delicate features on the fossils are not damaged. Preparators carefully select the materials used to strengthen or repair specimens. Adhesives, glues, and fillers must stand the test of time and not become brittle or discolored, just like the materials used to conserve works of art. The types of materials used are recorded in order to aid future preparators if further preparation or repair is required.\n\nThis video is part of a series, \"Dinosaurs Explained,\" produced by the American Museum of Natural History.

Although most skeletal mounts of dinosaurs seen in museums use replicas of actual fossil bones cast in fiberglass or plaster, which make them light and fairly easy to mount, most of the dinosaur mounts at AMNH were built using mostly real fossil bones, which are heavy yet extremely fragile. The dinosaur displays at AMNH represent the greatest collection of actual dinosaur specimens ever assembled.In planning a dinosaur mount, careful consideration is given to which specimen to use, usually the most complete set of bones from one individual. Then, a highly skilled group of specialists, including curators, preparators, mount-makers, engineers, and installers, work together to build, mount, and install the specimen for exhibition. First, the specimen must be meticulously prepared in the lab by preparators to ensure that all the cracks and fractures are solidly stabilized to withstand decades on display. Next, the curators work with the mount-makers to design an appropriate pose for the skeleton, often by creating detailed design drawings and scale models depicting each individual bone. Once this planning is complete, the assembly begins. The mount-makers, skilled artisans as well as metallurgists and blacksmiths, work with the curators and engineers to develop a metal framework, called an armature, to support the bones.  The armature must be engineered to support the whole skeleton and securely hold each bone without visually detracting the eye from the natural and often dynamic pose. The armature can either be external, in which the metal rods of the armature must be carefully bent to conform to the outline of the bones, or internal, in which the rods must be shaped to fit through holes drilled in the bones. Large mounts, such as the renovated T. rex mount posed in its stalking posture at AMNH, took a team of about 10 specialists about two years to build and reinstall in its new location.","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":25,"publishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:30:25.000Z","title":"How are skeletal mounts of dinosaurs in museum exhibits built?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FZNq4SgUqgE\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FZNq4SgUqgE\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FZNq4SgUqgE\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FZNq4SgUqgE\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/FZNq4SgUqgE\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"FZNq4SgUqgE"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"FZNq4SgUqgE","videoPublishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:32:35.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/t8TVF65d8QN3LzqZ9fUJBEYxgPA\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LjBCNTk1RUVDQjVGRkMwOUQ=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"In essence, fossils specimens are kept either on display in the Museum's exhibition halls or in specially designed collection facilities. In fact, only a small percentage of dinosaur specimens in most major museum's are on public display. Most specimens, although important for scientific research, are either duplicates of other specimens on display or are not easily recognizable to the general public.Although the fossils are basically rocks, modern collection rooms are climate-controlled in order to assure that temperature and humidity extremes do not compromise the adhesives and glues holding the naturally fractured bones and teeth together. Larger bones are housed on sturdy, padded shelves, whereas smaller bones and teeth are stored in labeled metal cabinets that contain adjustable, padded, wooden drawers. Each drawer usually holds many smaller specimens, each placed in an open cardboard box.Each specimen is assigned two numbers, one for the locality where it was collected and another for the specimen itself. These data, along with other data, are recorded on a small card that stays with the specimen and in a master catalogue that documents all the specimens in the collection. Other recorded data includes the genus and species the specimen represents, the rock unit the specimen comes from, the geologic age of the specimen, and the specimen's collector and date of collection. Increasingly, such data are combined for easy search and reference in a computerized database.A team of experts, including curators, collection managers, and preparators, is responsible for safeguarding the specimens, keeping them in proper order, and making them available for visiting scientists. All in all, the collection serves almost like a library of fossil bones.","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":26,"publishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:30:25.000Z","title":"Where are all the dinosaur fossils kept once they're prepared?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/r8ENj3lTTWk\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/r8ENj3lTTWk\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/r8ENj3lTTWk\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/r8ENj3lTTWk\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/r8ENj3lTTWk\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"r8ENj3lTTWk"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"r8ENj3lTTWk","videoPublishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:32:10.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/eGwWLia9lipS5pYc-QneFcNJ1A8\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LjVBODkxNzkzN0E3M0I2OTE=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"Although most of the news stories one reads about dinosaurs involve spectacular, if not speculative, aspects of dinosaur history, such as new theories about their behavior, extinction, or ecology, less attention is paid to studies analyzing their evolutionary relationships. This is unfortunate, because understanding questions of dinosaur behavior and biology depends on a firm understanding of their evolutionary relationships.To reconstruct the evolutionary relationships between different groups of dinosaurs, one must carefully study and analyze the anatomy, essentially searching for characteristics that are shared among different kinds of dinosaurs, which are then interpreted to have been present in the common ancestor, or first member of a group, and inherited by its descendants. This analysis produces a branching diagram, called a cladogram (See: Family Tree for Dinosaurs), on which different kinds of dinosaurs are shown at the endpoints of the branches. The branching points connecting the different branches represent the common ancestor for the group whose branches come out of that branching point, and based on the characteristics shared by dinosaurs on those branches, we can infer that those shared characteristics were present in the common ancestor.The result is a pattern of smaller groups of dinosaurs contained within larger groups of dinosaurs.  For example, T. rex is a member of a small group (Tyrannosauridae) that also contains Albertosaurus. Both those are members of a larger group, which contains other meat-eating dinosaurs such as Allosaurus, Velociraptor and birds, called Theropoda. Then, all theropods belong to a larger group that also contains the giant sauropods, called Saurischia. A good way to think about this is to compare it to your evolutionary relationships as a human. Humans, along with apes, belong to a larger group of mammals called hominoids, and hominoids along with monkeys, lemurs and tarsiers all belong to the larger group called primates. By following the sequence of characteristics inherited from more distant common ancestors to more recent ones, one can trace the anatomical evolution of a particular kind of animal ( See: Are there any dinosaurs still alive today?)","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":27,"publishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:30:25.000Z","title":"How Do We Know Which Kind of Dinosaurs Were Most Closely Related?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3gNw_6DoVc8\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3gNw_6DoVc8\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3gNw_6DoVc8\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3gNw_6DoVc8\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/3gNw_6DoVc8\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"3gNw_6DoVc8"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"3gNw_6DoVc8","videoPublishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:32:50.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/zKspwLqDEDcCLY4AHBihgpEHIy0\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LkE3NDc4RjgzOEQyNDg5OUE=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"There are two basic ways to tell geologic time and determine the age of a dinosaur fossil. One is called relative geologic time, which involves deciding whether one dinosaur fossil is older or younger than another. The other is often called absolute geologic time, which involves estimating how many millions of years old a dinosaur fossil is.\nTo determine relative age, one must realize that dinosaur fossils are preserved in layers of sedimentary rock, such as sandstone, siltstone, mudstone and limestone, which are deposited in sequence, one on top of the other. Geologists record the sequence of these layers in a drawing called a stratigraphic section. Since lower layers in the sequence were deposited first, they are older than higher layers in the sequence. Thus, fossils contained in a lower rock layer are relatively older than fossils contained in a higher layer.\nThe sequences of rock layers containing dinosaur fossils often also contain layers of ancient volcanic ash, and the ash is composed of minerals crystals formed at the time of the eruption, which contain radioactive atoms, such as Uranium-238 and Potassium-40. These break apart at a constant rate in a process called radioactive decay. The atoms that break apart are called parent atoms, while those that result are called daughter atoms. Using sophisticated scientific instruments, geologists can measure how long it takes for half of the parent atoms to decay into daughter atoms, a time period called the half-life (4.5 billion years for U-238 and 1.3 billion years for K-40). Geologists then measure the proportion of parent and daughter atoms present in the ash crystals to determine the crystal's age.   For example, if half the parent K-40 atoms in a crystal have decayed to Argon-40 daughter atoms, the age of the ash is 1.3 billion years old, and fossils in rock layers near the ash layer are also assumed to be about 1.3 billion years old.","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":28,"publishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:30:25.000Z","title":"How do we know how long ago dinosaurs lived?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6pYPqtdTnrM\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6pYPqtdTnrM\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6pYPqtdTnrM\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6pYPqtdTnrM\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/6pYPqtdTnrM\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"6pYPqtdTnrM"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"6pYPqtdTnrM","videoPublishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:32:21.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/8uyKcWJ_IXe5tnVNzdVgeiiP_P8\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LjNGMDMzNTI4QTUyRUVCMDQ=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"The key clues for answering this question are found in the sequences of rock layers that contain dinosaur fossils. Basically, the process involves documenting the composition of those ancient rock layers and finding out what environments in our modern world produce sediment of similar composition.Today, geologists can observe rain, ice, and wind eroding mountains and carrying the debris, called sediment, down rivers, streams, and glaciers to be deposited across floodplains, lakes, desert valleys, and ocean basins. Geologists can then document the kinds of sediment, such as sand, silt, and clay that are deposited in layers within each of these environmental settings and compare them to the kinds of rock layers, such as sandstone, siltstone, and mudstone, found in ancient rock sequences containing dinosaurs. Thus, observing present geologic processes is an important key to understanding past geologic environments, and dinosaur fossils can only be preserved where sediments are deposited that can quickly bury the skeletons and begin the processes of fossilization.Such studies have revealed that most of the dinosaurs we have found lived along ancient rivers or streams and roamed across the adjacent forested floodplains and densely vegetated swamps and lakes. Some discoveries have also shown that dinosaurs inhabited ancient deserts strewn with fields of sand dunes, and dinosaur skeletons have also been found along the sandy shorelines of ancient seas. Sediments representing mountainous environments are fairly rare, since erosion and not deposition is more common in these habitats. So examples of mountain-dwelling dinosaurs are also rare. Although a few dinosaur skeletons have been found in marine sediments, especially ones deposited near the shoreline, no dinosaurs have been documented to actually live in the oceans, and these rare skeletons in marine sediments appear to represent carcasses, carried by river currents, that floated out to sea before sinking to the bottom.","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":29,"publishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:30:25.000Z","title":"In what kind of environments did dinosaurs live?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/62Z-iSwh3i4\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/62Z-iSwh3i4\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/62Z-iSwh3i4\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/62Z-iSwh3i4\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/62Z-iSwh3i4\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"62Z-iSwh3i4"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"62Z-iSwh3i4","videoPublishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:33:02.000Z"}},{"etag":"\"XI7nbFXulYBIpL0ayR_gDh3eu1k\/PnZba_kFiuvtjBx6cZNSdcdlRoA\"","id":"UEwzRjA1RkQ1REFGQjUxMDA1LjFBQzcyMjg2QUI0NEQxNDc=","kind":"youtube#playlistItem","snippet":{"channelId":"UCMkybZyI_B-xgkLQo_eCQ_w","channelTitle":"American Museum of Natural History","description":"As with justifying any intellectual pursuit, such as painting and writing, dinosaur science cannot be evaluated simply on the monetary value of its products, even though they abound in popular culture. More importantly, studying dinosaurs provides important perspectives and appreciation of how humans are connected with other organisms and the natural processes that have and still do shape the history and future of our planet.Dinosaurs provide an intriguing and powerful vehicle for enhancing the public's scientific literacy through illustrating how science works through proposing hypotheses that can be tested and analyzed with evidence from the fossil record. The popularity of dinosaurs can also be used to teach about other scientific disciplines because ties between dinosaur paleontology and other sciences abound: limits of dinosaur size and speed (physics), environments dinosaurs lived in (geology), the age of dinosaur fossils (physics and chemistry), where dinosaurs lived (geography), and how birds are related to other dinosaurs (anatomy).Studying dinosaurs has played a key role in developing evolutionary theory and other scientific concepts, such as plate tectonics and biogeography. All of these pursuits arise as a result of humanity's innate curiosity to investigate how our world works and where we fit within the natural world we see around us.Finally, society has just begun coming to terms with issues involving our planet's biodiversity and related ecological challenges. From this perspective, the fossil record documents that we now live with a minute fraction of all the organisms that have existed in the past on our planet. Yet, we are connected to all of those organisms, past and present, through the long evolutionary history of life. As the fossil record of dinosaurs and other organisms illustrates, changing climates and episodes of extinction have altered the course of Earth's history for billions of years, a perspective that can help us better comprehend the challenges that we presently face.","playlistId":"PL3F05FD5DAFB51005","position":30,"publishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:30:25.000Z","title":"How does studying dinosaurs benefit humanity?","thumbnails":{"default":{"height":90,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vGzVaprEbqs\/default.jpg","width":120},"medium":{"height":180,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vGzVaprEbqs\/mqdefault.jpg","width":320},"high":{"height":360,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vGzVaprEbqs\/hqdefault.jpg","width":480},"standard":{"height":480,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vGzVaprEbqs\/sddefault.jpg","width":640},"maxres":{"height":720,"url":"https:\/\/i.ytimg.com\/vi\/vGzVaprEbqs\/maxresdefault.jpg","width":1280}},"resourceId":{"channelId":null,"kind":"youtube#video","playlistId":null,"videoId":"vGzVaprEbqs"}},"contentDetails":{"endAt":null,"note":null,"startAt":null,"videoId":"vGzVaprEbqs","videoPublishedAt":"2012-12-03T17:33:20.000Z"}}]}
